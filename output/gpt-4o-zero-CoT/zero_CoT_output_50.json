  "prompt": "Assume that there exist only two types of people: truth-tellers and liars. Truth-tellers always tell the truth, while liars always lie.\nYou are given the statements from 3 characters. Based on their statements, infer who is a truth-teller and who is a liar.\n\n\nBased on the following statements, infer who is a truth-teller and who is a liar:\nA: B is a truth-teller and C is a truth-teller.\nB: A is a liar.\nC: I am a truth-teller.\n\nLet's think step by step. First, explain your reasoning. End your answer by clearly stating the identity of each character in the following format:\n\nA: truth-teller/liar\nB: truth-teller/liar\nC: truth-teller/liar",
  "response": "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the statements made by each character and determine who is telling the truth and who is lying.\n\nLet's start by examining the possibilities:\n\n1. **Assume A is a truth-teller:**\n   - If A is a truth-teller, then A's statement \"B is a truth-teller and C is a truth-teller\" must be true.\n   - Therefore, both B and C are truth-tellers.\n   - But B, who is supposedly a truth-teller, says \"A is a liar,\" which contradicts our assumption that A is a truth-teller.\n   - Thus, there is a contradiction, so A cannot be a truth-teller.\n\n2. **Assume A is a liar:**\n   - If A is a liar, then A's statement \"B is a truth-teller and C is a truth-teller\" must be false.\n   - Therefore, at least one of B or C is a liar.\n   - Now, let's consider B's statement \"A is a liar.\" If B is a truth-teller, then this statement is consistent because it matches our current assumption that A is a liar.\n   - This means B could be a truth-teller.\n   - Next, consider C's statement \"I am a truth-teller.\" If C is a truth-teller, this statement would be truthful, but then A's claim that both B and C are truth-tellers would be partially true. So, C must be a liar to maintain the falseness of A's statement.\n\nGiven this analysis, the identities are:\n- A is a liar because his statement leads to contradictions if considered truthful.\n- B is a truth-teller as his statement aligns with the lies of A.\n- C is a liar, consistent with A's false statement that both B and C are truth-tellers.\n\nTherefore, the identities are:\n- A: liar\n- B: truth-teller\n- C: liar"
