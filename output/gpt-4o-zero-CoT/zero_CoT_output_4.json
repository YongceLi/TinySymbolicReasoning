  "prompt": "Assume that there exist only two types of people: truth-tellers and liars. Truth-tellers always tell the truth, while liars always lie.\nYou are given the statements from 3 characters. Based on their statements, infer who is a truth-teller and who is a liar.\n\n\nBased on the following statements, infer who is a truth-teller and who is a liar:\nA: C is a truth-teller and B is a liar.\nB: If A is a liar, then C is a liar.\nC: A is a truth-teller.\n\nLet's think step by step. First, explain your reasoning. End your answer by clearly stating the identity of each character in the following format:\n\nA: truth-teller/liar\nB: truth-teller/liar\nC: truth-teller/liar",
  "response": "To solve this problem, let's examine each statement while considering the consequences of each character being either a truth-teller or a liar.\n\n1. **Statement by A**: \"C is a truth-teller and B is a liar.\"\n\n   - If A is a truth-teller, then C must be a truth-teller and B must be a liar.\n   - If A is a liar, then at least one part of the statement is false, meaning either C is not a truth-teller or B is not a liar.\n\n2. **Statement by B**: \"If A is a liar, then C is a liar.\"\n\n   - If B is a truth-teller, then B's statement must be true, meaning if A is a liar, C must also be a liar.\n   - If B is a liar, then B's statement is false, meaning that A being a liar does not necessarily make C a liar; C could be a truth-teller even if A is a liar.\n\n3. **Statement by C**: \"A is a truth-teller.\"\n\n   - If C is a truth-teller, then A must be a truth-teller.\n   - If C is a liar, then A is not a truth-teller.\n\nLet's piece this information together:\n\n- Assume A is a truth-teller. \n  - Then C is a truth-teller (as per C's own statement), and B is a liar (as A claimed).\n  - This assumption is consistent with A and C being truth-tellers and B being a liar.\n  \n- Check for contradictions if A is a liar:\n  - If A is a liar, then C cannot be a truth-teller (as per C's statement), so C is a liar.\n  - If C is a liar, contradicting themself, this does not give a consistent role out of B's statement with what we assumed for A.\n  - Additionally, B's statement would be false if A is a liar, indicating C can be a truth-teller, which contradicts our assumption.\n\nTherefore, the scenario where A is a truth-teller and B is a liar with C being a truth-teller does not present any contradictions, and each piece of information aligns cohesively.\n\nThus, the identities are:\n- **A: truth-teller**\n- **B: liar**\n- **C: truth-teller**"
