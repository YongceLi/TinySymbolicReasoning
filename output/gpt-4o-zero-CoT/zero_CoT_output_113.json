  "prompt": "Assume that there exist only two types of people: truth-tellers and liars. Truth-tellers always tell the truth, while liars always lie.\nYou are given the statements from 3 characters. Based on their statements, infer who is a truth-teller and who is a liar.\n\n\nBased on the following statements, infer who is a truth-teller and who is a liar:\nA: C is a liar and B is a liar.\nB: C is a liar.\nC: A is a truth-teller and B is a truth-teller.\n\nLet's think step by step. First, explain your reasoning. End your answer by clearly stating the identity of each character in the following format:\n\nA: truth-teller/liar\nB: truth-teller/liar\nC: truth-teller/liar",
  "response": "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the statements given by each character (A, B, and C) and determine who is a truth-teller and who is a liar.\n\n1. **Analyze Statement by A**: \"C is a liar and B is a liar.\"\n   - If A is a truth-teller, then both C and B must be liars.\n   - If A is a liar, then at least one of C or B must be a truth-teller.\n\n2. **Analyze Statement by B**: \"C is a liar.\"\n   - If B is a truth-teller, then C must be a liar.\n   - If B is a liar, then C must be a truth-teller.\n\n3. **Analyze Statement by C**: \"A is a truth-teller and B is a truth-teller.\"\n   - If C is a truth-teller, then both A and B must be truth-tellers.\n   - If C is a liar, then at least one of A or B must be a liar.\n\nLet's work through these possibilities:\n\n- Assume A is a truth-teller:\n  - Then C and B are liars according to A's statement.\n  - B's statement \"C is a liar\" would be false if B is a liar, which is consistent.\n  - C's statement \"A is a truth-teller and B is a truth-teller\" is false, which is also consistent since C is a liar. This scenario fits all the conditions.\n\n- Assume A is a liar:\n  - Then either B or C or both must be truth-tellers.\n  - If B is a truth-teller, C is a liar.\n    - C's statement \"A is a truth-teller and B is a truth-teller\" would need to be true, which is a contradiction because A is assumed to be a liar.\n  - If C is a truth-teller, then according to C, both A and B are truth-tellers, which contradicts the assumption that A is a liar.\n  - This assumption leads to contradictions and cannot be true.\n\nTherefore, the most consistent scenario is:\n- A is a truth-teller, which means B and C must be liars.\n\nThus, the identities are:\nA: truth-teller\nB: liar\nC: liar"
