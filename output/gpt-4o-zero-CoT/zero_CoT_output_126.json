  "prompt": "Assume that there exist only two types of people: truth-tellers and liars. Truth-tellers always tell the truth, while liars always lie.\nYou are given the statements from 3 characters. Based on their statements, infer who is a truth-teller and who is a liar.\n\n\nBased on the following statements, infer who is a truth-teller and who is a liar:\nA: C is a liar and B is a liar.\nB: C is a liar and A is a liar.\nC: A is a truth-teller.\n\nLet's think step by step. First, explain your reasoning. End your answer by clearly stating the identity of each character in the following format:\n\nA: truth-teller/liar\nB: truth-teller/liar\nC: truth-teller/liar",
  "response": "To solve this, let's evaluate the statements step by step.\n\nFirst, let's assume that A is a truth-teller:\n- If A is a truth-teller, then A's statement \"C is a liar and B is a liar\" must be true. This means both B and C are liars.\n- If B is a liar, then B's statement \"C is a liar and A is a liar\" is false, which is consistent because we've assumed A is a truth-teller and concluded B is a liar.\n- If C is a liar, then C's statement \"A is a truth-teller\" must be false, which contradicts our assumption that A is a truth-teller.\n\nSince assuming A is a truth-teller leads to a contradiction, A must be a liar.\n\nNow let's assume B is a truth-teller:\n- If B is a truth-teller, then B's statement \"C is a liar and A is a liar\" must be true. So, both C and A are liars.\n- If C is a liar, then C's statement \"A is a truth-teller\" is false, which is consistent with our assumption that A is a liar.\n- If A is a liar, this is consistent with our assumption coming from B's statement.\n\nFinally, let's assume C is a truth-teller:\n- If C is a truth-teller, C's statement \"A is a truth-teller\" must be true. But if A is a truth-teller, then C's earlier statement making A a truth-teller also turns B into a liar, leading to no contradictions.\n\nLet's summarize:\n- Assuming B to be the truth-teller stays consistent without leading to contradictions among A and C when B labels them as liars.\n\nTherefore, from these deductions, the identifications are:\n\nA: liar\nB: truth-teller\nC: liar"
