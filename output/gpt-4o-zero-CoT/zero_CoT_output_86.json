  "prompt": "Assume that there exist only two types of people: truth-tellers and liars. Truth-tellers always tell the truth, while liars always lie.\nYou are given the statements from 3 characters. Based on their statements, infer who is a truth-teller and who is a liar.\n\n\nBased on the following statements, infer who is a truth-teller and who is a liar:\nA: I am a truth-teller.\nB: C is a truth-teller.\nC: B is a liar and A is a truth-teller.\n\nLet's think step by step. First, explain your reasoning. End your answer by clearly stating the identity of each character in the following format:\n\nA: truth-teller/liar\nB: truth-teller/liar\nC: truth-teller/liar",
  "response": "To solve the problem, we need to analyze the statements of each character and determine their truthfulness based on the given behavior of truth-tellers and liars.\n\n1. **Analyze A's Statement:**\n   - A says, \"I am a truth-teller.\"\n   - If A is a truth-teller, then this statement is true, and A is indeed a truth-teller.\n   - If A is a liar, then this statement would be false, implying A is a liar.\n\n2. **Analyze B's Statement:**\n   - B says, \"C is a truth-teller.\"\n   - If B is a truth-teller, then C is a truth-teller.\n   - If B is a liar, then C is not a truth-teller, meaning C is a liar.\n\n3. **Analyze C's Statement:**\n   - C says, \"B is a liar and A is a truth-teller.\"\n   - If C is a truth-teller, then this statement is true, meaning B is a liar and A is a truth-teller.\n   - If C is a liar, then at least one part of this statement must be false. Therefore, either B is not a liar (meaning B is a truth-teller), or A is not a truth-teller (meaning A is a liar).\n\n**Evaluation:**\n\nLet's assume A is a truth-teller.\n- If A is a truth-teller, then A's statement (\"I am a truth-teller.\") is true.\n\nThen, analyze B's statement where B says C is a truth-teller.\n- Since B's statement is dependent on who C is, let's check C's statement assuming B's guilty:\n  - If C says B is a liar and A is a truth-teller and B is a liar, then B's statement \"C is a truth-teller\" is false, since liars would lie. Hence, B must be a liar.\n\nTherefore, B is indeed a liar, making C's statement logical as that means C is a truth-teller.\n\nLet's verify:\n- C correctly says B is a liar and A is a truth-teller, making C a truth-teller.\n\nThus, the consistent setup leads to:\n- A is a truth-teller.\n- B is a liar.\n- C is a truth-teller.\n\nTherefore, the identity of each character is:\n```\nA: truth-teller\nB: liar\nC: truth-teller\n```"
