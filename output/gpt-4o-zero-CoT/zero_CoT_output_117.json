  "prompt": "Assume that there exist only two types of people: truth-tellers and liars. Truth-tellers always tell the truth, while liars always lie.\nYou are given the statements from 3 characters. Based on their statements, infer who is a truth-teller and who is a liar.\n\n\nBased on the following statements, infer who is a truth-teller and who is a liar:\nA: C is a truth-teller if and only if B is a truth-teller.\nB: C is a truth-teller.\nC: A is a truth-teller.\n\nLet's think step by step. First, explain your reasoning. End your answer by clearly stating the identity of each character in the following format:\n\nA: truth-teller/liar\nB: truth-teller/liar\nC: truth-teller/liar",
  "response": "To solve this, we need to analyze the logical dependencies in the statements:\n\n1. **A**: \"C is a truth-teller if and only if B is a truth-teller.\"\n\n   This means that both C and B are either truth-tellers together or liars together. \n\n2. **B**: \"C is a truth-teller.\"\n\n   If B is a truth-teller, then C must be a truth-teller, based on B's statement. If B is a liar, then C must be a liar.\n\n3. **C**: \"A is a truth-teller.\"\n\n   If C is a truth-teller, then A must be a truth-teller. If C is a liar, then A must be a liar.\n\nLet's evaluate the possibilities:\n\n- **Assume C is a truth-teller**:\n  - Based on C's statement, A must be a truth-teller.\n  - If A is a truth-teller, then according to A's statement, B must have the same truth value as C (both truth-tellers). So B must be a truth-teller.\n  - This scenario is consistent with B's statement that C is a truth-teller.\n\n- **Assume C is a liar**:\n  - Based on C's statement, A would be a liar.\n  - If A is a liar, then A's statement means that B and C do not share the same status (one is a truth-teller and one is a liar). Since C is already assumed a liar, B must be a truth-teller.\n  - This situation contradicts B's statement because B being a truth-teller alleged that C is a truth-teller. Thus this case is not possible.\n\nOnly the first scenario (C is a truth-teller) works consistently across all three statements. Thus, the identities of the characters are:\n\nA: truth-teller\nB: truth-teller\nC: truth-teller"
