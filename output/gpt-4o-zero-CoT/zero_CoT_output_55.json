  "prompt": "Assume that there exist only two types of people: truth-tellers and liars. Truth-tellers always tell the truth, while liars always lie.\nYou are given the statements from 3 characters. Based on their statements, infer who is a truth-teller and who is a liar.\n\n\nBased on the following statements, infer who is a truth-teller and who is a liar:\nA: B is a truth-teller if and only if C is a liar.\nB: If C is a truth-teller, then A is a truth-teller.\nC: B is a liar.\n\nLet's think step by step. First, explain your reasoning. End your answer by clearly stating the identity of each character in the following format:\n\nA: truth-teller/liar\nB: truth-teller/liar\nC: truth-teller/liar",
  "response": "To solve this problem, let's analyze the statements of each character:\n\n1. **Statement A**: \"B is a truth-teller if and only if C is a liar.\"\n   - This means: B is a truth-teller \u21d4 C is a liar.\n   - This statement will be true only if both B being a truth-teller implies C is a liar, and C being a liar implies B is a truth-teller.\n\n2. **Statement B**: \"If C is a truth-teller, then A is a truth-teller.\"\n   - This is a conditional statement: If C is a truth-teller, then A must also be a truth-teller.\n   \n3. **Statement C**: \"B is a liar.\"\n   - If C is a truth-teller, then this statement must be true, meaning B is a liar.\n\nLet's go through each possibility:\n\n- **Assume C is a truth-teller**:\n  - C says \"B is a liar,\" so B must be a liar.\n  - If B is a liar, B's statement (\"If C is a truth-teller, then A is a truth-teller\") is false. This means C can be a truth-teller, and yet A is not a truth-teller.\n  - Since the assumption led to a contradiction (B's statement being false while C is a truth-teller), C cannot be a truth-teller.\n\n- **Assume C is a liar**:\n  - If C is a liar, his statement \"B is a liar\" is false, so B must be a truth-teller.\n  - Given B is a truth-teller, let's examine B's statement: \"If C is a truth-teller, then A is a truth-teller.\"\n    - Since C is a liar, B's statement does not affect the truth of A directly.\n  - Now consider A's statement: \"B is a truth-teller if and only if C is a liar.\"\n    - Given B is a truth-teller and C is a liar, A's statement is true.\n\nTherefore, with C as a liar, both A and B's statements consistently make sense, with B being a truth-teller and A stating the truth as well.\n\nThe identities based on the analysis are:\n- A: truth-teller\n- B: truth-teller\n- C: liar"
