  "prompt": "Assume that there exist only two types of people: truth-tellers and liars. Truth-tellers always tell the truth, while liars always lie.\nYou are given the statements from 3 characters. Based on their statements, infer who is a truth-teller and who is a liar.\n\n\nBased on the following statements, infer who is a truth-teller and who is a liar:\nA: If C is a liar, then B is a truth-teller.\nB: A is a truth-teller.\nC: B is a liar.\n\nLet's think step by step. First, explain your reasoning. End your answer by clearly stating the identity of each character in the following format:\n\nA: truth-teller/liar\nB: truth-teller/liar\nC: truth-teller/liar",
  "response": "To solve the problem and determine the identities of A, B, and C, let's analyze the statements step by step.\n\n1. **Statement Analysis:**\n   - **A's statement:** \"If C is a liar, then B is a truth-teller.\"\n   - **B's statement:** \"A is a truth-teller.\"\n   - **C's statement:** \"B is a liar.\"\n\n2. **Consider C's statement:** \"B is a liar.\"\n   - If C is a truth-teller, then B must indeed be a liar.\n   - If C is a liar, then B must be a truth-teller.\n\n3. **Consider B\u2019s statement:** \"A is a truth-teller.\"\n   - If B is a truth-teller, then A is indeed a truth-teller.\n   - If B is a liar, then A is not a truth-teller (A is a liar).\n\n4. **Evaluate logic possibilities:**\n\n   **Assume C is a truth-teller:**\n   - C\u2019s statement \"B is a liar\" would be true, so B is a liar.\n   - B's statement \"A is a truth-teller\" would therefore be false, supporting the claim that B is a liar.\n   - If A's statement is analyzed with B as a liar and C as a truth-teller: \"If C is a liar, then B is a truth-teller\" becomes irrelevant because the premise is not met (C is not a liar).\n\n   This condition holds self-consistent: \n   - C is a truth-teller, B is a liar, A could still be consistent with being a truth-teller since the premise of A\u2019s statement is never triggered.\n\n   **Assume C is a liar:**\n   - C\u2019s statement \"B is a liar\" would be false, meaning B is a truth-teller.\n   - If B is a truth-teller, then A must be a truth-teller (according to B's statement).\n   - According to A\u2019s statement, \"If C is a liar (which we assumed), then B is a truth-teller\" holds true.\n\n   This condition leads to internal consistency with the assumption:\n   - C is a liar, B is a truth-teller, and A is a truth-teller.\n\n5. **Final conclusion:**\n   - Considering both possible scenarios, we reach a consistent identity for each character.\n\n**Identity of each character:**\n- A: truth-teller\n- B: truth-teller\n- C: liar"
