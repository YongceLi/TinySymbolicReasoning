  "prompt": "Assume that there exist only two types of people: truth-tellers and liars. Truth-tellers always tell the truth, while liars always lie.\nYou are given the statements from 3 characters. Based on their statements, infer who is a truth-teller and who is a liar.\n\n\nBased on the following statements, infer who is a truth-teller and who is a liar:\nA: C is a truth-teller and B is a liar.\nB: C is a liar.\nC: B is a truth-teller and A is a truth-teller.\n\nLet's think step by step. First, explain your reasoning. End your answer by clearly stating the identity of each character in the following format:\n\nA: truth-teller/liar\nB: truth-teller/liar\nC: truth-teller/liar",
  "response": "To determine who is a truth-teller and who is a liar, let's analyze each character's statements step-by-step.\n\n1. **Assume A is a truth-teller:**  \n   - This means A's statements are true. So, according to A, C is a truth-teller and B is a liar.\n   - But B says that C is a liar, which contradicts A's statement that C is a truth-teller.\n   - This inconsistency means that assuming A is a truth-teller leads to a contradiction. So, A cannot be a truth-teller and must be a liar.\n\n2. **Assume A is a liar:**  \n   - If A is a liar, then the statements \"C is a truth-teller\" and \"B is a liar\" are false.\n   - Since \"C is a truth-teller\" is false, C must be a liar.\n   - Since \"B is a liar\" is false, B must be a truth-teller.\n\n3. **Verify with B and C's statements:**\n   - Since B is a truth-teller, B's statement \"C is a liar\" must be true, which is consistent with C being a liar.\n   - C says \"B is a truth-teller and A is a truth-teller.\" We know that C is a liar, so this statement must be false. Therefore, either B is not a truth-teller or A is not a truth-teller, or both. We already found that A is not a truth-teller, which fits this scenario.\n\nGiven this analysis, the identities are:\n\nA: liar  \nB: truth-teller  \nC: liar"
