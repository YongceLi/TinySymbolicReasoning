  "prompt": "Assume that there exist only two types of people: truth-tellers and liars. Truth-tellers always tell the truth, while liars always lie.\nYou are given the statements from 3 characters. Based on their statements, infer who is a truth-teller and who is a liar.\n\n\nBased on the following statements, infer who is a truth-teller and who is a liar:\nA: B is a truth-teller and C is a liar.\nB: A is a liar.\nC: I am a truth-teller.\n\nLet's think step by step. First, explain your reasoning. End your answer by clearly stating the identity of each character in the following format:\n\nA: truth-teller/liar\nB: truth-teller/liar\nC: truth-teller/liar",
  "response": "Let's analyze each character's statements and determine if they are consistent, assuming each character is a truth-teller or a liar.\n\n1. **Assume A is a truth-teller:**\n   - If A is telling the truth, then B is a truth-teller and C is a liar.\n   - But if B is a truth-teller, then B's statement \"A is a liar\" must be true, which contradicts our assumption that A is a truth-teller.\n   - Therefore, A cannot be a truth-teller.\n\n2. **Assume A is a liar:**\n   - If A is lying, then B is not a truth-teller, meaning B is a liar, and C is not a liar, meaning C is a truth-teller.\n   - If B is a liar, then B's statement \"A is a liar\" is false, which is consistent since A must be a truth-teller for B's statement to be false, but this contradicts our assumption that A is a liar. So we need to rethink:\n   - A is a liar, and so B must actually be a truth-teller for A's statement that B is a truth-teller to be false (since a liar would lie about B's nature).\n   - C, initially assumed truth-teller under this assumption, saying \"I am a truth-teller\" must be a lie, meaning C must actually be a liar, which aligns perfectly here: \n   - A lies about B and C: so B is truth-teller, C liar. \n\nSince assuming A is a liar perfectly fits with B being a truth-teller and C being a liar:\n\n- A: liar\n- B: truth-teller\n- C: liar"
