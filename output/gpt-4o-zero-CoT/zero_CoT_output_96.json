  "prompt": "Assume that there exist only two types of people: truth-tellers and liars. Truth-tellers always tell the truth, while liars always lie.\nYou are given the statements from 3 characters. Based on their statements, infer who is a truth-teller and who is a liar.\n\n\nBased on the following statements, infer who is a truth-teller and who is a liar:\nA: C is a liar and B is a truth-teller.\nB: A is a liar and C is a liar.\nC: B is a liar and A is a liar.\n\nLet's think step by step. First, explain your reasoning. End your answer by clearly stating the identity of each character in the following format:\n\nA: truth-teller/liar\nB: truth-teller/liar\nC: truth-teller/liar",
  "response": "To solve this problem, we need to assess the statements made by each character and determine who is a truth-teller and who is a liar. We will consider the logical implications of each person being either a truth-teller or a liar, and see which scenario leads to a consistent, logical solution.\n\nLet's evaluate each character's statement:\n\n1. **Character A says: \"C is a liar and B is a truth-teller.\"**\n   - If A is a truth-teller, then C must be a liar, and B must be a truth-teller.\n   - If A is a liar, then C is not a liar (C is a truth-teller) and B is not a truth-teller (B is a liar).\n\n2. **Character B says: \"A is a liar and C is a liar.\"**\n   - If B is a truth-teller, then A must be a liar and C must be a liar.\n   - If B is a liar, then A is not a liar (A is a truth-teller) and C is not a liar (C is a truth-teller).\n\n3. **Character C says: \"B is a liar and A is a liar.\"**\n   - If C is a truth-teller, then B must be a liar and A must be a liar.\n   - If C is a liar, then B is not a liar (B is a truth-teller) and A is not a liar (A is a truth-teller).\n\nNow, let us analyze possible scenarios:\n\n- **Scenario 1: Assume A is a truth-teller.**\n  - According to A, C is a liar and B is a truth-teller.\n  - But if B is a truth-teller, according to B, A is a liar, which is a contradiction.\n  - Therefore, A cannot be a truth-teller.\n\n- **Scenario 2: Assume A is a liar.**\n  - If A is a liar, then C must be a truth-teller and B must be a liar.\n  - According to C (who is a truth-teller), B is a liar and A is a liar, which is consistent with our assumption.\n  - According to B (who is a liar), A is a liar and C is a liar, which is false since we assumed C is a truth-teller.\n  - This scenario holds consistent with all statements.\n\nThus, the consistent solution is:\n\nA: liar  \nB: liar  \nC: truth-teller  "
