  "prompt": "Assume that there exist only two types of people: truth-tellers and liars. Truth-tellers always tell the truth, while liars always lie.\nYou are given the statements from 3 characters. Based on their statements, infer who is a truth-teller and who is a liar.\n\n\nBased on the following statements, infer who is a truth-teller and who is a liar:\nA: B is a liar.\nB: If C is a liar, then A is a truth-teller.\nC: If B is a truth-teller, then A is a liar.\n\nLet's think step by step. First, explain your reasoning. End your answer by clearly stating the identity of each character in the following format:\n\nA: truth-teller/liar\nB: truth-teller/liar\nC: truth-teller/liar",
  "response": "To solve this, we need to analyze the statements made by each character:\n\n1. **Statement Analysis**:\n   - **A** says \"B is a liar.\"\n   - **B** says \"If C is a liar, then A is a truth-teller.\"\n   - **C** says \"If B is a truth-teller, then A is a liar.\"\n\n2. **Assume A is a truth-teller**:\n   - If A is a truth-teller, then A\u2019s statement \"B is a liar\" is true, which means B is a liar.\n   - If B is a liar, B's statement \"If C is a liar, then A is a truth-teller\" must be false. For this implication to be false when the antecedent is false (C is a liar), the consequent (A is a truth-teller) has to be false, contradicting our assumption. So A cannot be a truth-teller.\n\n3. **Assume A is a liar**:\n   - If A is a liar, then A's statement \"B is a liar\" is false, which means B is a truth-teller.\n   - If B is a truth-teller, then B's statement \"If C is a liar, then A is a truth-teller\" is true. For this implication to be true, when the antecedent (C is a liar) is true, the consequent (A is a truth-teller) must be true, leading to a contradiction since A is assumed to be a liar. Thus, C must be a truth-teller. \n   - If C is a truth-teller, then C's statement \"If B is a truth-teller, then A is a liar\" must be true. When B is a truth-teller, the statement supports our assumption that A is a liar.\n\nBased on the above deductions, the identities of the characters are:\n- A: liar\n- B: truth-teller\n- C: truth-teller"
