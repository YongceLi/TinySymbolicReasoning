  "prompt": "Assume that there exist only two types of people: truth-tellers and liars. Truth-tellers always tell the truth, while liars always lie.\nYou are given the statements from 3 characters. Based on their statements, infer who is a truth-teller and who is a liar.\n\n\nBased on the following statements, infer who is a truth-teller and who is a liar:\nA: C is a truth-teller and B is a liar.\nB: I am a truth-teller.\nC: B is a liar and A is a liar.\n\nLet's think step by step. First, explain your reasoning. End your answer by clearly stating the identity of each character in the following format:\n\nA: truth-teller/liar\nB: truth-teller/liar\nC: truth-teller/liar",
  "response": "To solve this, we need to evaluate the statements made by A, B, and C and determine who among them is a truth-teller and who is a liar.\n\n1. Statement by A: \"C is a truth-teller and B is a liar.\"\n   - If A is a truth-teller, then both parts of their statement must be true: C is a truth-teller, and B is a liar.\n   - If A is a liar, then at least one part of their statement is false: either C is not a truth-teller, or B is not a liar.\n\n2. Statement by B: \"I am a truth-teller.\"\n   - If B is a truth-teller, then this statement is true. Therefore, B indeed is a truth-teller.\n   - If B is a liar, then this statement is false, meaning B is not a truth-teller.\n\n3. Statement by C: \"B is a liar and A is a liar.\"\n   - If C is a truth-teller, both parts of their statement are true: B is a liar and A is a liar.\n   - If C is a liar, at least one part of their statement is false: either B is not a liar, or A is not a liar.\n\nNow, let's analyze these possibilities:\n\n- Assume A is a truth-teller:\n  - According to A, C is a truth-teller and B is a liar.\n  - If B is a liar, B's statement \"I am a truth-teller\" is indeed false.\n  - If C is a truth-teller, then C's statement \"B is a liar and A is a liar\" must be true. However, this contradicts that A is a truth-teller.\n\n- Assume A is a liar:\n  - Then C is not a truth-teller or B is not a liar (or both).\n  - From C's statement, \"B is a liar and A is a liar,\" if C is a truth-teller, then B must be a liar, and A is a liar.\n  - This works consistently: A is a liar, C is a truth-teller, and B is indeed a liar.\n\nConcluding from the consistent scenario where A is a liar, C is a truth-teller, and B is a liar:\n\nA: liar  \nB: liar  \nC: truth-teller"
