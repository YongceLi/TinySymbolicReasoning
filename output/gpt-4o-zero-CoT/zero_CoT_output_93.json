  "prompt": "Assume that there exist only two types of people: truth-tellers and liars. Truth-tellers always tell the truth, while liars always lie.\nYou are given the statements from 3 characters. Based on their statements, infer who is a truth-teller and who is a liar.\n\n\nBased on the following statements, infer who is a truth-teller and who is a liar:\nA: C is a truth-teller and B is a truth-teller.\nB: A is a truth-teller and C is a liar.\nC: B is a truth-teller.\n\nLet's think step by step. First, explain your reasoning. End your answer by clearly stating the identity of each character in the following format:\n\nA: truth-teller/liar\nB: truth-teller/liar\nC: truth-teller/liar",
  "response": "To solve this problem, let's analyze each statement and explore the possibilities logically.\n\n1. **Assume A is a truth-teller:**\n   - If A is a truth-teller, then A's entire statement must be true. According to A's statement, both C and B are truth-tellers.\n   - Therefore, if A is a truth-teller, B also must be a truth-teller.\n   - But if B is a truth-teller, B's statement indicates that C must be a liar (since B says C is a liar), which contradicts A's statement that C is a truth-teller.\n   - Hence, this assumption leads to a contradiction. Therefore, A cannot be a truth-teller.\n\n2. **Assume A is a liar:**\n   - If A is a liar, then A's entire statement must be false. So, at least one of C or B must be a liar.\n   - Now, we look at B's statement: \"A is a truth-teller and C is a liar.\"\n   - Since A is a liar (contradicting B's statement that A is a truth-teller), B's statement is partially false because B says A is a truth-teller, but B could still be a liar even if they say C is a liar. So B must also be a liar.\n   - Given B is a liar, B's statement that C is a liar must also be false, implying C is a truth-teller.\n\nTo verify:\n- A is a liar.\n- B is a liar.\n- C is a truth-teller.\n\nChecking the statements:\n- A's statement is false: C is a truth-teller is true, but B is a truth-teller is false; hence A is indeed a liar.\n- B's statement is false: A is not a truth-teller and C is not a liar, which is consistent with B being a liar.\n- C's statement: \"B is a truth-teller\" is false, which aligns with C being a truth-teller indicating B is indeed a liar.\n\nTherefore, the identities are:\n\nA: liar\nB: liar\nC: truth-teller"
