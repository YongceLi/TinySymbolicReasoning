  "prompt": "Assume that there exist only two types of people: truth-tellers and liars. Truth-tellers always tell the truth, while liars always lie.\nYou are given the statements from 3 characters. Based on their statements, infer who is a truth-teller and who is a liar.\n\n\nBased on the following statements, infer who is a truth-teller and who is a liar:\nA: C is a truth-teller.\nB: I am a truth-teller.\nC: A is a liar and B is a truth-teller.\n\nLet's think step by step. First, explain your reasoning. End your answer by clearly stating the identity of each character in the following format:\n\nA: truth-teller/liar\nB: truth-teller/liar\nC: truth-teller/liar",
  "response": "Let's analyze each statement:\n\n1. **Statement by A**: \"C is a truth-teller.\"\n   - If A is a truth-teller, then C must also be a truth-teller.\n\n2. **Statement by B**: \"I am a truth-teller.\"\n   - If B is a truth-teller, then B's statement is true, so B must indeed be a truth-teller.\n\n3. **Statement by C**: \"A is a liar and B is a truth-teller.\"\n   - If C is a truth-teller, then A must be a liar and B must be a truth-teller.\n\nLet's check these possibilities:\n\n- Assume A is a truth-teller:\n  - By A's statement, C is also a truth-teller.\n  - If C is a truth-teller, then by C's statement, A is a liar. This leads to a contradiction because A cannot be both a truth-teller and a liar.\n\n- Assume A is a liar:\n  - By A's statement being false, C must be a liar.\n  - If C is a liar, then C's statement is false, meaning it's not true that \"A is a liar and B is a truth-teller\". Thus, A must be a truth-teller or B must be a liar. Since A is already determined to be a liar, B must be a liar to satisfy the falsehood of C's statement.\n\nTherefore, we conclude:\n- A is a liar.\n- B is a liar.\n- C is a truth-teller (this is consistent as C's false statement implies B is not a truth-teller).\n\nThus, the identities of the characters are:\nA: liar\nB: liar\nC: truth-teller"
