  "prompt": "Assume that there exist only two types of people: truth-tellers and liars. Truth-tellers always tell the truth, while liars always lie.\nYou are given the statements from 3 characters. Based on their statements, infer who is a truth-teller and who is a liar.\n\n\nBased on the following statements, infer who is a truth-teller and who is a liar:\nA: B is a liar and C is a liar.\nB: C is a liar and A is a truth-teller.\nC: I am a truth-teller.\n\nLet's think step by step. First, explain your reasoning. End your answer by clearly stating the identity of each character in the following format:\n\nA: truth-teller/liar\nB: truth-teller/liar\nC: truth-teller/liar",
  "response": "To solve this problem, we need to consider the implications of each character's statements and determine who is a truth-teller and who is a liar.\n\n1. **Assume A is a truth-teller:**\n   - If A is a truth-teller, then A's statement \"B is a liar and C is a liar\" must be true. \n   - This means that both B and C are liars.\n\n2. **Validating the assumption:**\n   - If B is a liar (as stated by assumed truth-teller A), B's statement \"C is a liar and A is a truth-teller\" must be false.\n   - If B's statement is false, then either C is a truth-teller or A is a liar. However, we know A is a truth-teller in this assumption. Therefore, C must be a truth-teller.\n   - This leads to a contradiction because we assumed C is a liar.\n\nSince assuming A is a truth-teller leads to a contradiction, A must be a liar.\n\n3. **Assume A is a liar:**\n   - If A is a liar, then at least one part of A's statement \"B is a liar and C is a liar\" must be false. Hence, at least one of B or C is a truth-teller.\n\n4. **Analyze B\u2019s statement if B is a truth-teller:**\n   - If B is a truth-teller, B's statement \"C is a liar and A is a truth-teller\" must be true.\n   - But we assumed A is a liar, so B cannot be a truth-teller (contradiction).\n\nThus, if A is a liar, B must be a liar as well.\n\n5. **Determine C's status:**\n   - Since both A and B are liars, C must be the truth-teller by elimination.\n   - C\u2019s statement \"I am a truth-teller\" confirms this because it corresponds with our deduction.\n\nTherefore, the identities of the characters are:\n- A: liar\n- B: liar\n- C: truth-teller"
