  "prompt": "Assume that there exist only two types of people: truth-tellers and liars. Truth-tellers always tell the truth, while liars always lie.\nYou are given the statements from 3 characters. Based on their statements, infer who is a truth-teller and who is a liar.\n\n\nBased on the following statements, infer who is a truth-teller and who is a liar:\nA: C is a truth-teller and B is a truth-teller.\nB: A is a truth-teller and C is a liar.\nC: B is a truth-teller.\n\nLet's think step by step. First, explain your reasoning. End your answer by clearly stating the identity of each character in the following format:\n\nA: truth-teller/liar\nB: truth-teller/liar\nC: truth-teller/liar",
  "response": "Let's analyze the statements one by one and determine the identity of each character by checking for consistency.\n\n1. **Statement by A:** \"C is a truth-teller and B is a truth-teller.\"\n\n   - If A is a truth-teller, then both C and B must also be truth-tellers. \n   - If A is a liar, then at least one of C or B is a liar.\n\n2. **Statement by B:** \"A is a truth-teller and C is a liar.\"\n\n   - If B is a truth-teller, then A must be a truth-teller and C must be a liar.\n   - If B is a liar, then either A is a liar or C is not a liar (i.e., C is a truth-teller).\n\n3. **Statement by C:** \"B is a truth-teller.\"\n\n   - If C is a truth-teller, then B must be a truth-teller.\n   - If C is a liar, then B must be a liar.\n\nLet's use this information:\n\n- Assume A is a truth-teller: Then, C and B must also be truth-tellers (by A's statement). However, this contradicts B's statement that A is a truth-teller and C is a liar. Therefore, A cannot be a truth-teller; A must be a liar.\n\n- If A is a liar, then at least one of C or B is a liar. Let's explore the options:\n  \n   - Assume B is a truth-teller: \n     - According to B, A is a truth-teller and C is a liar. But we have determined that A is a liar, so B cannot be a truth-teller. Thus, B must be a liar.\n\n   - If B is a liar, then A is a liar (which matches our assumption), and B's statement about C being a liar is false, meaning C must be a truth-teller.\n\n- Verification:\n  - Since C is a truth-teller, C's statement that B is a truth-teller must be false. This is consistent with B being a liar.\n\nThus, the identities are:\n- A is a liar.\n- B is a liar.\n- C is a truth-teller.\n\nA: liar\nB: liar\nC: truth-teller"
