  "prompt": "Assume that there exist only two types of people: truth-tellers and liars. Truth-tellers always tell the truth, while liars always lie.\nYou are given the statements from 3 characters. Based on their statements, infer who is a truth-teller and who is a liar.\n\n\nBased on the following statements, infer who is a truth-teller and who is a liar:\nA: C is a truth-teller and B is a liar.\nB: C is a truth-teller.\nC: A is a truth-teller and B is a truth-teller.\n\nLet's think step by step. First, explain your reasoning. End your answer by clearly stating the identity of each character in the following format:\n\nA: truth-teller/liar\nB: truth-teller/liar\nC: truth-teller/liar",
  "response": "To solve this problem, let's analyze each statement and consider the implications.\n\n1. **Statement by A**: \"C is a truth-teller and B is a liar.\"\n   - If A is a truth-teller, then C is a truth-teller, and B is a liar.\n   - If A is a liar, then at least one part of the statement must be false, which means either C is a liar, or B is a truth-teller, or both.\n\n2. **Statement by B**: \"C is a truth-teller.\"\n   - If B is a truth-teller, then C must be a truth-teller.\n   - If B is a liar, then C must be a liar.\n\n3. **Statement by C**: \"A is a truth-teller and B is a truth-teller.\"\n   - If C is a truth-teller, then both A and B must be truth-tellers.\n   - If C is a liar, then at least one part of the statement must be false, meaning at least one of A or B is a liar.\n\nLet's evaluate these possibilities:\n\n- Assume A is a truth-teller:\n  - From A's statement: C is a truth-teller and B is a liar.\n  - From B's statement, since B is a liar, C should be a liar. This contradicts A's statement since C cannot be both a truth-teller and a liar. Therefore, this assumption is incorrect.\n\n- Assume A is a liar:\n  - From A's statement: At least one part of the statement is false. Therefore, C is a liar or B is a truth-teller, or both.\n  - From B's statement, if C is a liar, then B's statement is false, so B must be a liar.\n  - From C's statement, if C is a liar, then at least one of A or B is a liar. B is already a liar, so this is consistent.\n\nGiven these points, the scenario of A being a liar holds up:\n\n- A is a liar.\n- B is a liar.\n- C is a truth-teller, which matches the requirement since C's statement of A being a truth-teller (false) and B being a truth-teller (false) is indeed a lie.\n\nThus, the identities are:\n\nA: liar  \nB: liar  \nC: truth-teller"
