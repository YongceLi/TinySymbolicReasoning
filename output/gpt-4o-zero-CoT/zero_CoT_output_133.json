  "prompt": "Assume that there exist only two types of people: truth-tellers and liars. Truth-tellers always tell the truth, while liars always lie.\nYou are given the statements from 3 characters. Based on their statements, infer who is a truth-teller and who is a liar.\n\n\nBased on the following statements, infer who is a truth-teller and who is a liar:\nA: If C is a liar, then B is a liar.\nB: If A is a truth-teller, then C is a liar.\nC: B is a truth-teller and A is a truth-teller.\n\nLet's think step by step. First, explain your reasoning. End your answer by clearly stating the identity of each character in the following format:\n\nA: truth-teller/liar\nB: truth-teller/liar\nC: truth-teller/liar",
  "response": "To solve the problem, we'll analyze the statements using logical reasoning and the known behavior of truth-tellers and liars.\n\n1. **Statement Analysis:**\n\n   - **A:** \"If C is a liar, then B is a liar.\"\n   - **B:** \"If A is a truth-teller, then C is a liar.\"\n   - **C:** \"B is a truth-teller and A is a truth-teller.\"\n\n2. **Assumptions and Conclusions:**\n\n   - Assume **A** is a truth-teller:\n     - A's statement: A truth-teller's conditional statement is only false if the antecedent is true and the consequent is false. So, if C is a liar (true for the condition \"C is a liar\"), then B must also be a liar to keep A truthful. Let's see if this initial assumption matches other statements.\n     - B's statement: If A is a truth-teller, then according to B's statement, C must be a liar. With C being labeled a liar, B's statement holds true if B is a liar, as it otherwise contradicts this labeling due to possible veracity.\n     - C's statement: C claims both B and A are truth-tellers. If A is a truth-teller, C must be lying since only falsehood would suit C as we already assume A as truthful and C otherwise changes the narrative.\n     - Conclusion on assumption: With C as a liar and statement truthfulness being retained for both A's assertion and assuming B as a liar, we see mutual consistency in initially assuming A's truthfulness.\n\n   - Assume **A** is a liar:\n     - A's statement is false, meaning that \"C is a liar, then B is a liar\" must be false. This would imply that C is a truth-teller and B is a truth-teller to preserve the statement's false nature (converse not both liars).\n     - B's statement: If A is a liar, B's conditional statement suffers a falsification, implying C mustn't logically be a liar to maintain A's lie, contradicting B's truthfulness due to this inconsistency.\n     - C's assertion reflects B and A as truth-tellers, but as A is assumed to lie, only C as a liar can satisfy the contradiction demanded by hypothesizing C as truthful.\n     - Conclusion on assumption: Leads to a contradiction in trying to consistently maintain A as a liar through logical dichotomies.\n\n3. **Solution Determination:**\n\n   Testing through assumptions leads us to conclude:\n   - A maintains truthful consistency with both B and C labeled liars, avoiding contradictions in the initial truth setup.\n   - B and C falsify the logic necessary to singularly label truthfulness elsewhere, marking deception.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\n- A: truth-teller\n- B: liar\n- C: liar"
