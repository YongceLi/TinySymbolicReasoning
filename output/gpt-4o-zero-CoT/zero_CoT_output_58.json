  "prompt": "Assume that there exist only two types of people: truth-tellers and liars. Truth-tellers always tell the truth, while liars always lie.\nYou are given the statements from 3 characters. Based on their statements, infer who is a truth-teller and who is a liar.\n\n\nBased on the following statements, infer who is a truth-teller and who is a liar:\nA: If C is a liar, then B is a truth-teller.\nB: A is a liar and C is a liar.\nC: B is a liar if and only if A is a truth-teller.\n\nLet's think step by step. First, explain your reasoning. End your answer by clearly stating the identity of each character in the following format:\n\nA: truth-teller/liar\nB: truth-teller/liar\nC: truth-teller/liar",
  "response": "To solve this problem, we'll start by analyzing each statement and test for possible scenarios.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis:\n\n1. **Analyze A's Statement**: \n   - Statement: \"If C is a liar, then B is a truth-teller.\"\n   - Possible interpretations:\n     - If C is a liar, then B is a truth-teller.\n     - If C is a truth-teller, then we don't make any claim about B.\n\n2. **Analyze B's Statement**: \n   - Statement: \"A is a liar and C is a liar.\"\n   - For this to be true, both A and C must be liars. If A is a truth-teller, then this statement is false.\n\n3. **Analyze C's Statement**: \n   - Statement: \"B is a liar if and only if A is a truth-teller.\"\n   - This means B can only be a liar when A is a truth-teller and B can only be a truth-teller when A is a liar.\n\n### Testing Scenarios:\n\n- **Assume A is a truth-teller**:\n  - A's statement is true: If C is a liar, then B is a truth-teller.\n  - According to C's statement, if A is a truth-teller, then B is a liar.\n  - This is a contradiction because A's statement would require B to be a truth-teller if C is a liar.\n  - So, A cannot be a truth-teller.\n\n- **Assume A is a liar**:\n  - Therefore, A's statement is false: If C is a liar, then B is a truth-teller is false. Possible situations:\n    - C is a liar and B is a liar.\n    - This aligns with B's statement: \"A is a liar and C is a liar.\" B's statement can then be true if and only if B is a truth-teller.\n  - With A being a liar, C's statement implies that B is a truth-teller.\n\nIf A is a liar:\n- A lies, confirming B is a truth-teller.\n- B's statement \"A is a liar and C is a liar\" means B is a truth-teller and C is a liar.\n\nThis scenario does not lead to any contradictions:\n\n**Final Identities**:\n- A: liar\n- B: truth-teller\n- C: liar"
