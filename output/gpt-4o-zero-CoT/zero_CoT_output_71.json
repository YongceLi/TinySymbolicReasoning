  "prompt": "Assume that there exist only two types of people: truth-tellers and liars. Truth-tellers always tell the truth, while liars always lie.\nYou are given the statements from 3 characters. Based on their statements, infer who is a truth-teller and who is a liar.\n\n\nBased on the following statements, infer who is a truth-teller and who is a liar:\nA: C is a truth-teller.\nB: A is a liar and C is a truth-teller.\nC: B is a truth-teller.\n\nLet's think step by step. First, explain your reasoning. End your answer by clearly stating the identity of each character in the following format:\n\nA: truth-teller/liar\nB: truth-teller/liar\nC: truth-teller/liar",
  "response": "To solve this problem, let's analyze the statements of A, B, and C step by step, exploring different possibilities from the constraints that truth-tellers always tell the truth and liars always lie.\n\n1. **Assume A is a truth-teller:**\n   - If A is a truth-teller, then A's statement that \"C is a truth-teller\" must be true.\n   - This means C must be a truth-teller.\n   - However, if C is a truth-teller, C's statement \"B is a truth-teller\" must also be true, which implies B is also a truth-teller.\n   - If B is a truth-teller, B's statement \"A is a liar and C is a truth-teller\" must be true.\n   - However, B's statement has a contradiction; both A being a liar and C being a truth-teller cannot be true if A is assumed a truth-teller. \n   - Therefore, our assumption that A is a truth-teller leads to a contradiction.\n\n2. **Assume A is a liar:**\n   - If A is a liar, then A's statement \"C is a truth-teller\" must be false.\n   - This means C must be a liar.\n   - If C is a liar, then C's statement \"B is a truth-teller\" must be false.\n   - Therefore, B must be a liar.\n   - However, if B is a liar, B's statement \"A is a liar and C is a truth-teller\" must be false.\n   - B's statement is indeed false if both A and C are liars, because B claimed C is a truth-teller, which contradicts our assumption.\n   - Thus, our conclusion is that A, B, and C being all liars is consistent and has no contradictions.\n\nIn conclusion, based on the logical consistency of the assumptions and statements, we can determine:\n\nA: liar  \nB: liar  \nC: liar  "
