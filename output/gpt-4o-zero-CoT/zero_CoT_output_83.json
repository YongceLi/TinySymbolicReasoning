  "prompt": "Assume that there exist only two types of people: truth-tellers and liars. Truth-tellers always tell the truth, while liars always lie.\nYou are given the statements from 3 characters. Based on their statements, infer who is a truth-teller and who is a liar.\n\n\nBased on the following statements, infer who is a truth-teller and who is a liar:\nA: B is a truth-teller.\nB: C is a truth-teller and A is a truth-teller.\nC: B is a liar.\n\nLet's think step by step. First, explain your reasoning. End your answer by clearly stating the identity of each character in the following format:\n\nA: truth-teller/liar\nB: truth-teller/liar\nC: truth-teller/liar",
  "response": "To solve this problem, let's analyze each character's statements step by step:\n\n1. **Statement by A:** \"B is a truth-teller.\"\n   - If A is a truth-teller, then B is indeed a truth-teller.\n   - If A is a liar, then B must be a liar.\n\n2. **Statement by B:** \"C is a truth-teller and A is a truth-teller.\"\n   - If B is a truth-teller, then both C and A must be truth-tellers.\n   - If B is a liar, then at least one of the statements about C being a truth-teller or A being a truth-teller must be false.\n\n3. **Statement by C:** \"B is a liar.\"\n   - If C is a truth-teller, then B is indeed a liar.\n   - If C is a liar, then B is a truth-teller.\n\nNow, let's consider the possible scenarios:\n\n- **Scenario 1:** Assume A is a truth-teller. \n  - If A is a truth-teller, then B is a truth-teller (according to A's statement).\n  - However, if B is a truth-teller, then both C and A must be truth-tellers (according to B's statement). But this contradicts C's statement that B is a liar. Therefore, A cannot be a truth-teller.\n\n- **Scenario 2:** Assume A is a liar.\n  - If A is a liar, then B is a liar (opposite of A's statement).\n  - If B is a liar, then at least one of B's claims must be false. So either C is not a truth-teller or A is not a truth-teller. But since we assumed A is already a liar, B being a liar is consistent.\n  - If B is a liar, then C's statement (that B is a liar) is true, making C a truth-teller.\n\n- After evaluating both scenarios, only Scenario 2 works without contradictions.\n\nIn conclusion:\n\nA: liar  \nB: liar  \nC: truth-teller"
