  "prompt": "Assume that there exist only two types of people: truth-tellers and liars. Truth-tellers always tell the truth, while liars always lie.\nYou are given the statements from 3 characters. Based on their statements, infer who is a truth-teller and who is a liar.\n\n\nBased on the following statements, infer who is a truth-teller and who is a liar:\nA: C is a liar.\nB: C is a truth-teller and A is a truth-teller.\nC: A is a truth-teller and B is a truth-teller.\n\nLet's think step by step. First, explain your reasoning. End your answer by clearly stating the identity of each character in the following format:\n\nA: truth-teller/liar\nB: truth-teller/liar\nC: truth-teller/liar",
  "response": "To solve the problem and determine who is a truth-teller and who is a liar, let's analyze each character's statements considering the characteristics of truth-tellers and liars:\n\n1. **Assume A is a truth-teller:**\n   - If A is a truth-teller, then A's statement \"C is a liar\" must be true. Therefore, C must be a liar.\n   - If C is a liar, then C's statement \"A is a truth-teller and B is a truth-teller\" must be false. This means at least one part of the statement is false, so B cannot be a truth-teller.\n   - If B is not a truth-teller, B must be a liar.\n   - Let\u2019s verify B's statement: If B is a liar, then the statement \"C is a truth-teller and A is a truth-teller\" is false, which aligns with our assumption that C is a liar and it also implies B must be a liar.\n   - This configuration is consistent.\n\n2. **Assume A is a liar:**\n   - If A is a liar, then A's statement \"C is a liar\" must be false. Therefore, C must be a truth-teller.\n   - If C is a truth-teller, then C's statement \"A is a truth-teller and B is a truth-teller\" must be true. However, we assumed A is a liar, which contradicts C's statement.\n   - This contradiction means the assumption that A is a liar is not possible.\n\nTherefore, based on the consistent scenario, the identities of the characters are:\n\nA: truth-teller\nB: liar\nC: liar"
