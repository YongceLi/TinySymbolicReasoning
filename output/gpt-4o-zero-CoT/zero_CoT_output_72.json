  "prompt": "Assume that there exist only two types of people: truth-tellers and liars. Truth-tellers always tell the truth, while liars always lie.\nYou are given the statements from 3 characters. Based on their statements, infer who is a truth-teller and who is a liar.\n\n\nBased on the following statements, infer who is a truth-teller and who is a liar:\nA: B is a liar if and only if C is a truth-teller.\nB: A is a truth-teller.\nC: If B is a truth-teller, then A is a liar.\n\nLet's think step by step. First, explain your reasoning. End your answer by clearly stating the identity of each character in the following format:\n\nA: truth-teller/liar\nB: truth-teller/liar\nC: truth-teller/liar",
  "response": "To solve the problem, we need to analyze the statements given by characters A, B, and C, and determine their truthfulness based on the criteria that truth-tellers always tell the truth and liars always lie.\n\nLet's break down each statement:\n\n1. **A's statement**: \"B is a liar if and only if C is a truth-teller.\"\n   - This can be broken into two parts:\n     - If B is a liar, then C is a truth-teller.\n     - If C is a truth-teller, then B is a liar.\n     - This statement suggests that C and B cannot have the same truth value (one is a truth-teller, the other a liar).\n\n2. **B's statement**: \"A is a truth-teller.\"\n   - If B is a truth-teller, then A is indeed a truth-teller.\n   - If B is a liar, then A is a liar.\n\n3. **C's statement**: \"If B is a truth-teller, then A is a liar.\"\n   - If B is a truth-teller, the statement implies A must be a liar.\n   - If C is a truth-teller, since the first condition fails (it would make B true and thus A false but B contradicts that with A being true), B must be a liar.\n\nLet's evaluate possible scenarios:\n\n- **Assume A is a truth-teller:**\n  - A's statement implies B and C have opposite truth values (one liar, one truth-teller).\n  - If B is a truth-teller (from his statement), then A is a truth-teller, which matches our assumption.\n  - If C\u2019s statement \"If B is a truth-teller, then A is a liar\" needs to be false (since A is a truth-teller), then B must be a liar.\n  - Therefore, if B is a liar, C must be a truth-teller.\n\nSo in this scenario:\n- A: truth-teller\n- B: liar \n- C: truth-teller\n\n- **Assume A is a liar:**\n  - If A is a liar, their statement is false, meaning B and C have the same truth value.\n  - B's statement \"A is a truth-teller\" must be false (as B is a liar), confirming A is a liar.\n  - C\u2019s statement would need to be true for C to be a truth-teller, but it leads to contradictions because B cannot be a truth-teller if C is truthful.\n\nThe only consistent scenario is:\n- A is truthful, which makes B a liar and C a truth-teller.\n\nThus, the identities are:\n- A: truth-teller\n- B: liar\n- C: truth-teller"
