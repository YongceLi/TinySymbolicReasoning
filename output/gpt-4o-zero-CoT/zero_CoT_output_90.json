  "prompt": "Assume that there exist only two types of people: truth-tellers and liars. Truth-tellers always tell the truth, while liars always lie.\nYou are given the statements from 3 characters. Based on their statements, infer who is a truth-teller and who is a liar.\n\n\nBased on the following statements, infer who is a truth-teller and who is a liar:\nA: B is a truth-teller and C is a truth-teller.\nB: A is a truth-teller if and only if C is a truth-teller.\nC: A is a liar.\n\nLet's think step by step. First, explain your reasoning. End your answer by clearly stating the identity of each character in the following format:\n\nA: truth-teller/liar\nB: truth-teller/liar\nC: truth-teller/liar",
  "response": "To solve this problem, let's analyze the statements step by step.\n\n1. **Analyze C's statement:**\n   - C says that A is a liar. \n   - If C is a truth-teller, then A is indeed a liar. If C is a liar, then A is actually a truth-teller.\n\n2. **Analyze B's statement:**\n   - B states that \"A is a truth-teller if and only if C is a truth-teller.\" This statement means that A and C must have the same identity (either both are truth-tellers or both are liars).\n   - If B is a truth-teller, then the statement is true: A and C must be the same.\n   - If B is a liar, then A and C are not the same (one is a truth-teller, and the other is a liar).\n\n3. **Analyze A's statement:**\n   - A claims that both B and C are truth-tellers.\n   - If A is a truth-teller, then both B and C are truth-tellers.\n   - If A is a liar, then at least one of B or C is a liar.\n\n### Considering Consistent Scenarios:\n- **Suppose A is a truth-teller:**\n  - Then A's statement implies that B and C both are truth-tellers.\n  - However, C says that A is a liar. This contradicts our assumption.\n  - Therefore, A cannot be a truth-teller.\n\n- **Suppose A is a liar:**\n  - Then B and C cannot both be truth-tellers (as otherwise A would have been telling the truth).\n  - From C's perspective, if A is a liar, then C is telling the truth (C's statement that A is a liar is correct).\n  - Thus, C is a truth-teller when A is a liar.\n\n- **If C is a truth-teller (from the above assumption that A is a liar):**\n  - A is indeed a liar as confirmed by C.\n  - B, according to C being a truth-teller, agrees that A is not telling the truth. \n  - B's statement becomes false since A and C have different identities (one is a liar, and the other is a truth-teller), hence B is a liar.\n\nThus, based on logical deductions:\n\nA: liar  \nB: liar  \nC: truth-teller"
