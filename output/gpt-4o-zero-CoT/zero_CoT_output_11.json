  "prompt": "Assume that there exist only two types of people: truth-tellers and liars. Truth-tellers always tell the truth, while liars always lie.\nYou are given the statements from 3 characters. Based on their statements, infer who is a truth-teller and who is a liar.\n\n\nBased on the following statements, infer who is a truth-teller and who is a liar:\nA: C is a liar and B is a truth-teller.\nB: C is a liar.\nC: A is a liar and B is a truth-teller.\n\nLet's think step by step. First, explain your reasoning. End your answer by clearly stating the identity of each character in the following format:\n\nA: truth-teller/liar\nB: truth-teller/liar\nC: truth-teller/liar",
  "response": "To solve this problem, we must analyze the statements and determine the consistency of each possible scenario. We are given:\n\n- A: C is a liar and B is a truth-teller.\n- B: C is a liar.\n- C: A is a liar and B is a truth-teller.\n\nLet's consider each character one by one:\n\n1. Assume A is a truth-teller:\n   - If A is telling the truth, then both parts of their statement must be true: C is a liar and B is a truth-teller.\n   - However, if B is a truth-teller, then B's statement (\"C is a liar\") is also true.\n   - Thus, C must indeed be a liar, which would make C's statement (\"A is a liar and B is a truth-teller\") false.\n   - This scenario is consistent as everything aligns: A is a truth-teller, B is a truth-teller, and C is a liar.\n\n2. Assume A is a liar:\n   - If A is lying, then at least one part of their statement must be false: Either C is not a liar, or B is not a truth-teller, or both.\n   - If C is not a liar, then C is a truth-teller. C's statement that \"A is a liar and B is a truth-teller\" would then mean that both parts must be true.\n   - Since A is accurately identified as a liar under this assumption, let's see if B's claim holds.\n   - If B is a truth-teller, then B's statement \"C is a liar\" should be true; however, we assumed C to be a truth-teller here. This inconsistency means our assumption that A is a liar does not hold.\n\nHence, the only consistent scenario is that A is a truth-teller, B is a truth-teller, and C is a liar. This aligns with all statements and roles.\n\nA: truth-teller  \nB: truth-teller  \nC: liar"
