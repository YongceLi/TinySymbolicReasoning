  "prompt": "Assume that there exist only two types of people: truth-tellers and liars. Truth-tellers always tell the truth, while liars always lie.\nYou are given the statements from 3 characters. Based on their statements, infer who is a truth-teller and who is a liar.\n\n\nBased on the following statements, infer who is a truth-teller and who is a liar:\nA: C is a truth-teller.\nB: A is a truth-teller and C is a liar.\nC: B is a truth-teller and A is a liar.\n\nLet's think step by step. First, explain your reasoning. End your answer by clearly stating the identity of each character in the following format:\n\nA: truth-teller/liar\nB: truth-teller/liar\nC: truth-teller/liar",
  "response": "To determine who is a truth-teller and who is a liar, let's analyze each statement step by step:\n  \n1. **Assume A is a truth-teller:**\n   - If A is a truth-teller, then A's statement that \"C is a truth-teller\" is true, so C must also be a truth-teller.\n   - If C is a truth-teller, C's statement that \"B is a truth-teller and A is a liar\" must be true. However, C's statement claims A is a liar, which contradicts our original assumption that A is a truth-teller. Therefore, this scenario is inconsistent.\n\n2. **Assume A is a liar:**\n   - If A is a liar, then A's statement that \"C is a truth-teller\" must be false, so C is a liar.\n   - Since C is a liar, C's statement that \"B is a truth-teller and A is a liar\" must be false. Therefore, either B is not a truth-teller or A is not a liar. We've assumed A is a liar, so the false part must be that B is not a truth-teller, making B a liar as well.\n\nWith A as a liar, both B and C are also liars, which means no contradictions arise in this scenario.\n\nTherefore, the identities are:\n- A: liar\n- B: liar\n- C: liar"
