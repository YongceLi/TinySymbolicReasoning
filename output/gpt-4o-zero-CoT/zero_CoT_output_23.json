  "prompt": "Assume that there exist only two types of people: truth-tellers and liars. Truth-tellers always tell the truth, while liars always lie.\nYou are given the statements from 3 characters. Based on their statements, infer who is a truth-teller and who is a liar.\n\n\nBased on the following statements, infer who is a truth-teller and who is a liar:\nA: C is a liar and B is a truth-teller.\nB: C is a liar and A is a liar.\nC: B is a truth-teller if and only if A is a truth-teller.\n\nLet's think step by step. First, explain your reasoning. End your answer by clearly stating the identity of each character in the following format:\n\nA: truth-teller/liar\nB: truth-teller/liar\nC: truth-teller/liar",
  "response": "To determine who the truth-tellers and liars are, let's analyze each character's statement through logical reasoning:\n\n1. A's statement: \"C is a liar and B is a truth-teller.\"\n   - If A is a truth-teller, then C is indeed a liar, and B is a truth-teller.\n   - If A is a liar, then either C is a truth-teller or B is a liar (or both).\n\n2. B's statement: \"C is a liar and A is a liar.\"\n   - If B is a truth-teller, then C is indeed a liar, and A is a liar.\n   - If B is a liar, then either C is a truth-teller or A is a truth-teller (or both).\n\n3. C's statement: \"B is a truth-teller if and only if A is a truth-teller.\"\n   - This is a biconditional statement. It means either both B and A are truth-tellers, or both are liars.\n\nNow, let's analyze these statements together:\n\nAssume A is a truth-teller:\n- From A's statement, C is a liar and B is a truth-teller.\n- If B is a truth-teller, based on B's statement, C is a liar and A is a liar, which contradicts our assumption that A is a truth-teller. Therefore, A can't be a truth-teller.\n\nAssume A is a liar:\n- From A's statement, at least one part of C being a liar or B being a truth-teller is false.\n- Since A is a liar, C must be a truth-teller, and B must be a liar.\n- Let's verify this assumption:\n  - Since B is a liar, B's statement is false: this means B being a liar means that at least one of C being a liar or A being a liar is false. However, we've already assumed A is a liar, and our assumption of C being a truth-teller holds.\n  - C's statement \"B is a truth-teller if and only if A is a truth-teller\" is false because B is a liar and A is a liar, meaning C is making a false biconditional statement, supporting that C is indeed a truth-teller.\n\nTherefore, the final identification is:\n- A is a liar.\n- B is a liar.\n- C is a truth-teller.\n\nA: liar  \nB: liar  \nC: truth-teller  "
