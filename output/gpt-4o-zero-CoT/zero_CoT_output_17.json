  "prompt": "Assume that there exist only two types of people: truth-tellers and liars. Truth-tellers always tell the truth, while liars always lie.\nYou are given the statements from 3 characters. Based on their statements, infer who is a truth-teller and who is a liar.\n\n\nBased on the following statements, infer who is a truth-teller and who is a liar:\nA: B is a truth-teller if and only if C is a truth-teller.\nB: C is a liar and A is a liar.\nC: A is a truth-teller.\n\nLet's think step by step. First, explain your reasoning. End your answer by clearly stating the identity of each character in the following format:\n\nA: truth-teller/liar\nB: truth-teller/liar\nC: truth-teller/liar",
  "response": "To solve this problem, let's analyze the statements given by each character step by step.\n\n1. **Statement from A**: \n   \"B is a truth-teller if and only if C is a truth-teller.\"\n   - This is a logical biconditional statement. It means that both B and C are either truth-tellers together or liars together.\n\n2. **Statement from B**:\n   \"C is a liar and A is a liar.\"\n   - If B is a truth-teller, then C must be a liar and A must be a liar. However, if B is a liar, then at least one part of this statement (or both) is false.\n\n3. **Statement from C**:\n   \"A is a truth-teller.\"\n   - If C is a truth-teller, then A must be a truth-teller. If C is a liar, then A must not be a truth-teller (meaning A is a liar).\n\nLet's test different possibilities to see what consistently aligns with all statements.\n\n- **Assume A is a truth-teller**:  \n  If A is a truth-teller, then B is a truth-teller if and only if C is a truth-teller.  \n  From C's statement that A is a truth-teller, C also claims A's truthfulness. Thus, C would be a truth-teller in this scenario.\n  If C is a truth-teller, B must also be a truth-teller.  \n  But if B is a truth-teller, then B's statement that C is a liar would create a contradiction (because we assumed C is a truth-teller).  \n  Therefore, our initial assumption that A is a truth-teller is incorrect.\n\n- **Assume A is a liar**:  \n  If A is a liar, then the statement \"B is a truth-teller if and only if C is a truth-teller\" is false, implying that one of B or C is a truth-teller, and the other is a liar.\n\nFrom C\u2019s statement, \"A is a truth-teller,\" it follows that C is lying (since we assume A is a liar). So, C must be a liar.\n\nSince A is a liar (by assumption) and C is a liar (as concluded), B is consistent with his statement \"C is a liar and A is a liar.\" Thus, B must be telling the truth.\n\nConclusion:  \n- A is a liar.  \n- B is a truth-teller.  \n- C is a liar.\n\n**Final Answer:**\nA: liar  \nB: truth-teller  \nC: liar"
