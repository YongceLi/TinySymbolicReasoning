  "prompt": "Assume that there exist only two types of people: truth-tellers and liars. Truth-tellers always tell the truth, while liars always lie.\nYou are given the statements from 3 characters. Based on their statements, infer who is a truth-teller and who is a liar.\n\n\nBased on the following statements, infer who is a truth-teller and who is a liar:\nA: C is a truth-teller and B is a truth-teller.\nB: A is a truth-teller and C is a liar.\nC: A is a liar.\n\nLet's think step by step. First, explain your reasoning. End your answer by clearly stating the identity of each character in the following format:\n\nA: truth-teller/liar\nB: truth-teller/liar\nC: truth-teller/liar",
  "response": "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the statements made by each character, considering the fact that truth-tellers always tell the truth and liars always lie.\n\n1. **Analyze A's statement:**\n   - A says: \"C is a truth-teller and B is a truth-teller.\"\n   - If A is a truth-teller, then both C and B must also be truth-tellers.\n   - If A is a liar, then at least one of C or B must be a liar.\n\n2. **Analyze B's statement:**\n   - B says: \"A is a truth-teller and C is a liar.\"\n   - If B is a truth-teller, then A must be a truth-teller (which means C must also be a truth-teller according to A's statement) and C must be a liar, which is a contradiction.\n   - Thus, B cannot be a truth-teller, so B must be a liar.\n\n3. **Analyze C's statement:**\n   - C says: \"A is a liar.\"\n   - If C is a truth-teller, then A must be a liar.\n   - If C is a liar, then A must be a truth-teller.\n\n4. **Correlate all statements:**\n   - From step 2, we know B is a liar. Therefore, A cannot be a truth-teller, as B's statement that \"A is a truth-teller\" would then be true, contradicting B being a liar. Thus, A must be a liar.\n   - Since A is a liar, A's statement \"C is a truth-teller\" must be false, which means C must be a liar too.\n\nSo, both A and C must be liars, and since there is always at least one truth-teller, B being labeled a liar in step 2 must only be regarding the truth of their statement (as it was logically dismantled). Therefore, B is actually contradicting their own truth-status and thus revealing themselves as the sole truth-teller caught in the statement's contradiction loop.\n\nFinal identities:\n\nA: liar  \nB: truth-teller  \nC: liar"
