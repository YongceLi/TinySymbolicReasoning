  "prompt": "Assume that there exist only two types of people: truth-tellers and liars. Truth-tellers always tell the truth, while liars always lie.\nYou are given the statements from 3 characters. Based on their statements, infer who is a truth-teller and who is a liar.\n\n\nBased on the following statements, infer who is a truth-teller and who is a liar:\nA: C is a liar and B is a liar.\nB: If A is a truth-teller, then C is a truth-teller.\nC: If B is a truth-teller, then A is a truth-teller.\n\nLet's think step by step. First, explain your reasoning. End your answer by clearly stating the identity of each character in the following format:\n\nA: truth-teller/liar\nB: truth-teller/liar\nC: truth-teller/liar",
  "response": "To determine who is a truth-teller and who is a liar, we must analyze each character's statements.\n\n1. **Statement by A**: \"C is a liar and B is a liar.\"\n   - If A is a truth-teller, then both B and C are liars.\n   - If A is a liar, at least one of B or C is a truth-teller.\n\n2. **Statement by B**: \"If A is a truth-teller, then C is a truth-teller.\"\n   - This is an implication statement (\"if A, then C\").\n   - If B is a truth-teller, the implication must hold true (if A is truth-teller, C must be truth-teller).\n   - If B is a liar, the implication is false (if A is truth-teller, C is not a truth-teller).\n\n3. **Statement by C**: \"If B is a truth-teller, then A is a truth-teller.\"\n   - This is another implication statement (\"if B, then A\").\n   - If C is a truth-teller, the implication must hold true.\n   - If C is a liar, the implication is false (if B is truth-teller, A is not a truth-teller).\n\nLet's explore the possibilities:\n\n- **Assume A is a truth-teller**:\n  - C is a liar (from A's statement), so implication by C is false. This fits since C is a liar.\n  - B is a liar (from A's statement), so implication by B is false. This fits since B is a liar.\n\nIn this scenario:\n- A is telling the truth by calling B and C liars, which is consistent.\n\n- **Assume A is a liar**:\n  - At least one of B or C is a truth-teller.\n  - If B is a truth-teller, then A must be a truth-teller (from C's statement), which is a contradiction.\n  - So, C must be the truth-teller if A is a liar.\n\nIn this scenario, B, being a liar, would make the implication statement false:\n- If A is a truth-teller, then C is not a truth-teller (to keep B's statement false if B is a liar), aligning with A being a liar.\n\nThus, this leads consistently to the conclusion that:\n- A is a truth-teller: B and C need to be liars to satisfy A's true statement.\n- B is a liar: Fits B's false implication.\n- C is a liar: Fits C's false implication.\n\nFinal answer:\nA: truth-teller\nB: liar\nC: liar"
