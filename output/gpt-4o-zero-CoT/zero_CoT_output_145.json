  "prompt": "Assume that there exist only two types of people: truth-tellers and liars. Truth-tellers always tell the truth, while liars always lie.\nYou are given the statements from 3 characters. Based on their statements, infer who is a truth-teller and who is a liar.\n\n\nBased on the following statements, infer who is a truth-teller and who is a liar:\nA: C is a truth-teller and B is a liar.\nB: If C is a liar, then A is a truth-teller.\nC: If A is a truth-teller, then B is a truth-teller.\n\nLet's think step by step. First, explain your reasoning. End your answer by clearly stating the identity of each character in the following format:\n\nA: truth-teller/liar\nB: truth-teller/liar\nC: truth-teller/liar",
  "response": "To determine who is a truth-teller and who is a liar, we need to analyze the statements provided by A, B, and C.\n\n1. **Analyzing A's Statement:**\n   - A says: \"C is a truth-teller and B is a liar.\"\n   - If A is a truth-teller, then C must be a truth-teller, and B must be a liar.\n   - If A is a liar, then at least one part of the statement must be false: either C is a liar or B is a truth-teller.\n\n2. **Analyzing B's Statement:**\n   - B says: \"If C is a liar, then A is a truth-teller.\"\n   - This is a conditional statement. If C is a liar, the statement implies A must be a truth-teller for B to be truthful.\n   - If B is a truth-teller and C is indeed a liar, then A would be a truth-teller. If B is a liar, then even if C is a liar, A must not be a truth-teller, to make B's statement false.\n\n3. **Analyzing C's Statement:**\n   - C says: \"If A is a truth-teller, then B is a truth-teller.\"\n   - This is another conditional statement. If C is a truth-teller, then if A is truthful, B must also be truthful.\n   - If C is a liar, then either A is a truth-teller and B is not, or A is a liar, making C's statement false.\n\nNow, let's evaluate possible scenarios:\n\n**Scenario 1: A is a truth-teller**\n- Then according to A, C is a truth-teller and B is a liar.\n- If C is a truth-teller, then according to C's statement, if A is a truth-teller, B must also be a truth-teller, which contradicts B being a liar.\n- Thus, this scenario is impossible.\n\n**Scenario 2: A is a liar**\n- According to A, C cannot be a truth-teller or B cannot be a liar (or both).\n- If B is a truth-teller, then according to B's statement, if C is a liar, A must be a truth-teller, which contradicts our assumption that A is a liar.\n- Therefore, B must be a liar, so B's whole statement is false, implying that C is a truth-teller or A is not a truth-teller (matching our assumption that A is a liar).\n  \nNow, if C is a truth-teller:\n- C's statement is: if A is a truth-teller, then B is a truth-teller. Because we assumed A is a liar, this condition is automatically satisfied in terms of making C's statement true.\n\nSo, under the assumption that A is a liar, C is a truth-teller and B is a liar. All statements align consistently under this configuration without contradiction.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nA: liar  \nB: liar  \nC: truth-teller"
