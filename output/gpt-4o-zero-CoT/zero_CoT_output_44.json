  "prompt": "Assume that there exist only two types of people: truth-tellers and liars. Truth-tellers always tell the truth, while liars always lie.\nYou are given the statements from 3 characters. Based on their statements, infer who is a truth-teller and who is a liar.\n\n\nBased on the following statements, infer who is a truth-teller and who is a liar:\nA: B is a liar.\nB: C is a liar.\nC: A is a liar and B is a liar.\n\nLet's think step by step. First, explain your reasoning. End your answer by clearly stating the identity of each character in the following format:\n\nA: truth-teller/liar\nB: truth-teller/liar\nC: truth-teller/liar",
  "response": "To determine who is a truth-teller and who is a liar, we can analyze the statements logically, considering the implications if each character were a truth-teller or a liar.\n\n1. **Assume A is a truth-teller:**\n   - If A is a truth-teller, then A's statement \"B is a liar\" is true, meaning B must be a liar.\n   - If B is a liar, then B's statement \"C is a liar\" must be false, which implies that C is a truth-teller.\n   - If C is a truth-teller, then C's statement \"A is a liar and B is a liar\" must be true. However, C's statement contradicts the assumption that A is a truth-teller. Thus, A cannot be a truth-teller.\n\n2. **Assume A is a liar:**\n   - If A is a liar, then A's statement \"B is a liar\" is false, meaning B must be a truth-teller.\n   - If B is a truth-teller, then B's statement \"C is a liar\" is true, so C must be a liar.\n   - If C is a liar, then C's statement \"A is a liar and B is a liar\" is false. Since we assumed A is indeed a liar and B is a truth-teller, C's statement is correctly false.\n\nGiven these points, the only consistent scenario is when A is a liar, B is a truth-teller, and C is a liar.\n\nSo, the identities are:\nA: liar\nB: truth-teller\nC: liar"
