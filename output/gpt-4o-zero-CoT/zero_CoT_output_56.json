  "prompt": "Assume that there exist only two types of people: truth-tellers and liars. Truth-tellers always tell the truth, while liars always lie.\nYou are given the statements from 3 characters. Based on their statements, infer who is a truth-teller and who is a liar.\n\n\nBased on the following statements, infer who is a truth-teller and who is a liar:\nA: If C is a liar, then B is a truth-teller.\nB: If C is a liar, then A is a truth-teller.\nC: If B is a truth-teller, then A is a liar.\n\nLet's think step by step. First, explain your reasoning. End your answer by clearly stating the identity of each character in the following format:\n\nA: truth-teller/liar\nB: truth-teller/liar\nC: truth-teller/liar",
  "response": "To solve the problem, let's analyze the given statements step-by-step and consider the possible scenarios for each character:\n\n1. **Assume C is a truth-teller:**\n   - If C is a truth-teller, then C's statement \"If B is a truth-teller, then A is a liar\" must be true.\n   - This means that if B is a truth-teller, A must be a liar.\n   - But if B is a truth-teller, B's statement \"If C is a liar, then A is a truth-teller\" is false because C is not a liar (contradiction).\n\n   Hence, C cannot be a truth-teller.\n\n2. **Assume C is a liar:**\n   - If C is a liar, then C's statement \"If B is a truth-teller, then A is a liar\" is false.\n   - This means that if B is a truth-teller, A is not a liar, i.e., A is a truth-teller.\n\n3. Let's verify the consistency if C is a liar:\n   - From C being a liar, we know that if B is a truth-teller, then A is a truth-teller.\n   - Consider B's statement: \"If C is a liar, then A is a truth-teller.\"\n   - Since C is indeed a liar, B's statement must be true for B to be a truth-teller. Hence, A must be a truth-teller.\n\n4. Lastly, let's confirm A's statement in this setup:\n   - A states \"If C is a liar, then B is a truth-teller.\"\n   - We know C is a liar (as per our assumption) and for A (truth-teller) to be consistent, B must be a truth-teller.\n\nThus, under the assumption that C is a liar:\n- A and B both become truth-tellers.\n- C remains a liar.\n\nSo, the identities are as follows:\n- A: truth-teller\n- B: truth-teller\n- C: liar"
