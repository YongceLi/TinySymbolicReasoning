  "prompt": "Assume that there exist only two types of people: truth-tellers and liars. Truth-tellers always tell the truth, while liars always lie.\nYou are given the statements from 3 characters. Based on their statements, infer who is a truth-teller and who is a liar.\n\n\nBased on the following statements, infer who is a truth-teller and who is a liar:\nA: B is a truth-teller and C is a liar.\nB: C is a liar and A is a liar.\nC: B is a liar.\n\nLet's think step by step. First, explain your reasoning. End your answer by clearly stating the identity of each character in the following format:\n\nA: truth-teller/liar\nB: truth-teller/liar\nC: truth-teller/liar",
  "response": "To solve this problem, let's evaluate each person's statements assuming they could be either a truth-teller or a liar, and see which scenario is consistent.\n\n1. **Assume A is a truth-teller:**\n\n   - If A is a truth-teller, A's statement \"B is a truth-teller and C is a liar\" must be true.\n   - If B is a truth-teller, then B's statement \"C is a liar and A is a liar\" must be true.\n     - But this creates a contradiction because B's statement claims A is a liar, which contradicts our assumption that A is a truth-teller. Therefore, A cannot be a truth-teller.\n\n2. **Assume A is a liar:**\n\n   - If A is a liar, A's statement \"B is a truth-teller and C is a liar\" is false.\n   - Therefore, B is not a truth-teller and C is not a liar.\n   - If C is not a liar, then C must be a truth-teller.\n   - C being a truth-teller means C's statement \"B is a liar\" is true.\n   - Therefore, B is a liar.\n\nWith this assumption, we have:\n- A is a liar (consistent).\n- B is a liar (consistent with both A's false statements and C's truth).\n- C is a truth-teller.\n\nThe assumption that A is a liar satisfies all the truth conditions and does not lead to any contradictions.\n\nTherefore, the identity of each character is:\n\nA: liar  \nB: liar  \nC: truth-teller"
