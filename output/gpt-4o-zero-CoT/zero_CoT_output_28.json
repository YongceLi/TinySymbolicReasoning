  "prompt": "Assume that there exist only two types of people: truth-tellers and liars. Truth-tellers always tell the truth, while liars always lie.\nYou are given the statements from 3 characters. Based on their statements, infer who is a truth-teller and who is a liar.\n\n\nBased on the following statements, infer who is a truth-teller and who is a liar:\nA: C is a liar if and only if B is a truth-teller.\nB: C is a liar if and only if A is a truth-teller.\nC: If B is a truth-teller, then A is a truth-teller.\n\nLet's think step by step. First, explain your reasoning. End your answer by clearly stating the identity of each character in the following format:\n\nA: truth-teller/liar\nB: truth-teller/liar\nC: truth-teller/liar",
  "response": "To determine who is a truth-teller and who is a liar, we need to analyze the statements step by step:\n\n1. **Statement A**: \"C is a liar if and only if B is a truth-teller.\"\n   - This means either both C is a liar and B is a truth-teller, or both C is a truth-teller and B is a liar.\n\n2. **Statement B**: \"C is a liar if and only if A is a truth-teller.\"\n   - Similar to the first statement, this means either both C is a liar and A is a truth-teller, or both C is a truth-teller and A is a liar.\n\n3. **Statement C**: \"If B is a truth-teller, then A is a truth-teller.\"\n   - This is a straightforward conditional: if B is a truth-teller, then A must also be a truth-teller.\n\nNow, let's reason through the possible scenarios:\n\n- **Assume A is a truth-teller**:\n  - From B's statement: \"C is a liar if and only if A is a truth-teller.\" If A is a truth-teller, then C must be a liar.\n  - From A's statement: \"C is a liar if and only if B is a truth-teller.\" If C is a liar, then B must be a truth-teller.\n  - From C's statement: \"If B is a truth-teller, then A is a truth-teller.\" This holds true since A is indeed a truth-teller.\n  - All statements are consistent.\n\n- **Assume A is a liar**:\n  - From B's statement: \"C is a liar if and only if A is a truth-teller.\" If A is a liar, then C must be a truth-teller.\n  - From A's statement: \"C is a liar if and only if B is a truth-teller.\" If A is a liar, then the statement is false, meaning C is a truth-teller and B is a liar. \n  - From C's statement: \"If B is a truth-teller, then A is a truth-teller.\" If C is telling the truth and B is a liar, then C's statement doesn't contradict because B is not a truth-teller. However, if B were a truth-teller, C's statement would be invalid, causing inconsistency.\n\nTherefore, the only consistent scenario is when A is a truth-teller, B is a truth-teller, and C is a liar.\n\nFinal identities:\nA: truth-teller  \nB: truth-teller  \nC: liar  "
