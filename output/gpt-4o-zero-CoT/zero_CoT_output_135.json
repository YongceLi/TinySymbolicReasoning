  "prompt": "Assume that there exist only two types of people: truth-tellers and liars. Truth-tellers always tell the truth, while liars always lie.\nYou are given the statements from 3 characters. Based on their statements, infer who is a truth-teller and who is a liar.\n\n\nBased on the following statements, infer who is a truth-teller and who is a liar:\nA: C is a truth-teller and B is a liar.\nB: C is a truth-teller.\nC: B is a truth-teller and A is a truth-teller.\n\nLet's think step by step. First, explain your reasoning. End your answer by clearly stating the identity of each character in the following format:\n\nA: truth-teller/liar\nB: truth-teller/liar\nC: truth-teller/liar",
  "response": "Let's analyze the statements step by step:\n\n1. **Assume A is a truth-teller:**\n   - If A is telling the truth, then C is a truth-teller, and B is a liar.\n   - However, if C is a truth-teller, then C's statement (that B is a truth-teller and A is a truth-teller) must be true.\n   - This is a contradiction because we initially assumed B is a liar. Therefore, A cannot be a truth-teller.\n\n2. **Assume A is a liar:**\n   - If A is lying, then C is a liar or B is a truth-teller (or both).\n   - This opens two possibilities:\n     - **C is a liar and B is a truth-teller:** \n       - If B is telling the truth, then B's statement that C is a truth-teller is wrong, which is consistent because we know C is a liar.\n       - Therefore, this scenario is consistent.\n     - **B is a liar:** \n       - If B is lying, then C is not a truth-teller, implying C must be a liar.\n       - Since C claims both A and B are truth-tellers, and knowing that C is a liar based on the assumption, A must be a liar and B must be a liar which contradicts the situation because there should be at least one truth-teller.\n       - Hence, this scenario is inconsistent.\n\nTherefore, the only consistent scenario is when A is a liar, B is a truth-teller, and C is a liar.\n\nFinal conclusions:\n- A is a liar.\n- B is a truth-teller.\n- C is a liar.\n\nA: liar  \nB: truth-teller  \nC: liar"
