  "prompt": "Assume that there exist only two types of people: truth-tellers and liars. Truth-tellers always tell the truth, while liars always lie.\nYou are given the statements from 3 characters. Based on their statements, infer who is a truth-teller and who is a liar.\n\n\nBased on the following statements, infer who is a truth-teller and who is a liar:\nA: B is a truth-teller.\nB: C is a liar.\nC: A is a truth-teller and B is a liar.\n\nLet's think step by step. First, explain your reasoning. End your answer by clearly stating the identity of each character in the following format:\n\nA: truth-teller/liar\nB: truth-teller/liar\nC: truth-teller/liar",
  "response": "To determine who is a truth-teller and who is a liar, let's analyze each character's statements and check for consistency:\n\n1. **Assume A is a truth-teller:**\n   - If A is a truth-teller, then A's statement \"B is a truth-teller\" must be true. So, B is a truth-teller.\n     - If B is a truth-teller, then B's statement \"C is a liar\" must be true. So, C is a liar.\n     - If C is a liar, then C's statement \"A is a truth-teller and B is a liar\" must be false. \n     - This must mean either A is not a truth-teller or B is not a liar.\n       - Since we assumed A is a truth-teller, and B cannot be both a truth-teller and a liar, there is a contradiction. Thus, A cannot be a truth-teller.\n   \n2. **Assume A is a liar:**\n   - If A is a liar, then A's statement \"B is a truth-teller\" must be false. So, B is a liar.\n   - If B is a liar, then B's statement \"C is a liar\" must be false. So, C is a truth-teller.\n   - If C is a truth-teller, then C's statement \"A is a truth-teller and B is a liar\" must be true.\n     - In this statement, since A is not a truth-teller (our initial assumption), B must indeed be a liar for C's full statement to be true.\n   - There is no contradiction here.\n\nWith this analysis, we have consistently assigned roles without contradictions:\n\nA: liar\nB: liar\nC: truth-teller"
