  "prompt": "Assume that there exist only two types of people: truth-tellers and liars. Truth-tellers always tell the truth, while liars always lie.\nYou are given the statements from 3 characters. Based on their statements, infer who is a truth-teller and who is a liar.\n\n\nBased on the following statements, infer who is a truth-teller and who is a liar:\nA: B is a liar and C is a liar.\nB: If A is a liar, then C is a truth-teller.\nC: If B is a liar, then A is a truth-teller.\n\nLet's think step by step. First, explain your reasoning. End your answer by clearly stating the identity of each character in the following format:\n\nA: truth-teller/liar\nB: truth-teller/liar\nC: truth-teller/liar",
  "response": "To solve this problem, we start by analyzing the given statements:\n\n1. A: B is a liar and C is a liar.\n2. B: If A is a liar, then C is a truth-teller.\n3. C: If B is a liar, then A is a truth-teller.\n\nLet's consider possibilities step by step:\n\n### Possibility 1: Assume A is a truth-teller.\n- If A is a truth-teller, then A's statement \"B is a liar and C is a liar\" must be true.\n- Therefore, B is a liar and C is a liar. \n- If B is a liar, then B's statement \"If A is a liar, then C is a truth-teller\" is false. This is consistent, since A is not a liar.\n- However, C as a liar would mean C's statement \"If B is a liar, then A is a truth-teller\" should be false (but A is indeed a truth-teller, which makes the statement not false).\n\nThus, assuming A as a truth-teller leads to a contradiction. Therefore, A must be a liar.\n\n### Possibility 2: Assume A is a liar.\n- If A is a liar, then A's statement \"B is a liar and C is a liar\" is false. This means either B is a truth-teller or C is a truth-teller (or both).\n- Since A is a liar, B's conditional statement \"If A is a liar, then C is a truth-teller\" must be true. So, C is a truth-teller.\n- C being a truth-teller means C's statement \"If B is a liar, then A is a truth-teller\" must be true. Since it's true and C is a truth-teller, B is not a liar.\n\nSince B is not a liar, B must be a truth-teller.\n\nTherefore, the identities of each character are:\n\nA: liar  \nB: truth-teller  \nC: truth-teller  "
