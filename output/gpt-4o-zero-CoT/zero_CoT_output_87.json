  "prompt": "Assume that there exist only two types of people: truth-tellers and liars. Truth-tellers always tell the truth, while liars always lie.\nYou are given the statements from 3 characters. Based on their statements, infer who is a truth-teller and who is a liar.\n\n\nBased on the following statements, infer who is a truth-teller and who is a liar:\nA: C is a truth-teller and B is a liar.\nB: If A is a truth-teller, then C is a truth-teller.\nC: B is a liar and A is a liar.\n\nLet's think step by step. First, explain your reasoning. End your answer by clearly stating the identity of each character in the following format:\n\nA: truth-teller/liar\nB: truth-teller/liar\nC: truth-teller/liar",
  "response": "To solve this problem, let's analyze the statements logically.\n\n1. **Analyze A's Statement**: \n   - A says \"C is a truth-teller and B is a liar.\"\n   - If A is a truth-teller, then C must be a truth-teller and B must be a liar.\n\n2. **Analyze B's Statement**:\n   - B says \"If A is a truth-teller, then C is a truth-teller.\"\n   - This is a conditional statement. It does not directly tell us B's stance but gives a relation if A is a truth-teller. If A is a truth-teller, this statement should naturally be true (truth-tellers cannot lie).\n   - If B is a liar, the statement is false, meaning A is a truth-teller, and C is a liar.\n\n3. **Analyze C's Statement**:\n   - C says \"B is a liar and A is a liar.\"\n   - If C is a truth-teller, then both A and B are liars, which creates a contradiction because the statements from A and B lead us to different consequences.\n   - Therefore, C must be a liar (otherwise we get a contradiction).\n\nGiven these analyses:\n\n- If A is a truth-teller, C is a truth-teller (as per A\u2019s statement), but since C's statements result in contradictions, C cannot be a truth-teller. Thus, A cannot be a truth-teller, so A must be a liar.\n  \n- Since A is a liar, consider B's statement:\n  - \"If A is a truth-teller, then C is a truth-teller\" is false only if A is a truth-teller and C is not a truth-teller. But since A is a liar, B's statement being false doesn't affect the conclusion. Therefore, B doesn't contradict himself and can be a truth-teller.\n  \n- If B is a truth-teller:\n  - A is a liar, and C must be a liar too, consistent with our findings.\n  \nNow, let's confirm:\n- A is a liar: His statement about C being a truth-teller and B being a liar is false.\n- B is a truth-teller: His conditional statement holds true when A is evaluated as a liar.\n- C is a liar: His statement about both A and B being liars is false.\n\nThus, we have determined:\n\nA: liar  \nB: truth-teller  \nC: liar"
