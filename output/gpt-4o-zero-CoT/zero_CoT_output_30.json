  "prompt": "Assume that there exist only two types of people: truth-tellers and liars. Truth-tellers always tell the truth, while liars always lie.\nYou are given the statements from 3 characters. Based on their statements, infer who is a truth-teller and who is a liar.\n\n\nBased on the following statements, infer who is a truth-teller and who is a liar:\nA: C is a truth-teller and B is a truth-teller.\nB: C is a liar and A is a truth-teller.\nC: B is a liar if and only if A is a liar.\n\nLet's think step by step. First, explain your reasoning. End your answer by clearly stating the identity of each character in the following format:\n\nA: truth-teller/liar\nB: truth-teller/liar\nC: truth-teller/liar",
  "response": "Let's analyze each statement step by step:\n\n1. **Statement A**: \"C is a truth-teller and B is a truth-teller.\"\n   - If A is a truth-teller, then both B and C must be truth-tellers. However, this would cause a contradiction with statement B, which we will check next.\n   - If A is a liar, then at least one of C or B must not be a truth-teller.\n\n2. **Statement B**: \"C is a liar and A is a truth-teller.\"\n   - If B is a truth-teller, then C must be a liar and A must be a truth-teller. However, this would contradict A's statement that B is a truth-teller.\n   - If B is a liar, then C cannot be a liar or A cannot be a truth-teller, or both.\n\n3. **Statement C**: \"B is a liar if and only if A is a liar.\"\n   - This is a biconditional statement, meaning that B and A must be either both liars or both truth-tellers.\n\nNow, let's examine these with hypotheticals:\n\n- Assume A is a truth-teller:\n  - Then C and B must be truth-tellers from A's statement.\n  - But B's statement would contradict this (since B would imply A is truthful but claims C is a liar).\n- Therefore, A cannot be a truth-teller.\n\n- Assume A is a liar:\n  - At least one of B or C must be a liar.\n  - Based on C\u2019s statement \"B is a liar if and only if A is a liar.\" If C is a truth-teller, then A is a liar and B is a liar (matching C's claim). This satisfies all conditions.\n\nThus:\n- If A is a liar, B must be a liar (satisfying statement C when C is a truth-teller).\n- C must be a truth-teller, as this covers the conditions provided without contradictions.\n\nHence, the identities are:\n\nA: liar  \nB: liar  \nC: truth-teller"
