  "prompt": "Assume that there exist only two types of people: truth-tellers and liars. Truth-tellers always tell the truth, while liars always lie.\nYou are given the statements from 3 characters. Based on their statements, infer who is a truth-teller and who is a liar.\n\n\nBased on the following statements, infer who is a truth-teller and who is a liar:\nA: C is a truth-teller and B is a truth-teller.\nB: A is a liar if and only if C is a truth-teller.\nC: B is a truth-teller.\n\nLet's think step by step. First, explain your reasoning. End your answer by clearly stating the identity of each character in the following format:\n\nA: truth-teller/liar\nB: truth-teller/liar\nC: truth-teller/liar",
  "response": "To determine who is a truth-teller and who is a liar, let's analyze each statement logically:\n\n1. **Statement A**: \"C is a truth-teller and B is a truth-teller.\"\n   - If A is a truth-teller, then both B and C must be truth-tellers.\n   - If A is a liar, then at least one of B or C must be a liar.\n\n2. **Statement B**: \"A is a liar if and only if C is a truth-teller.\"\n   - If B is a truth-teller, then this statement is true, meaning A is indeed a liar if C is a truth-teller.\n   - If B is a liar, then the statement does not hold, meaning A is not a liar, or C is not a truth-teller, but not both.\n\n3. **Statement C**: \"B is a truth-teller.\"\n   - If C is a truth-teller, then B must be a truth-teller.\n   - If C is a liar, then B is a liar.\n\nNow, let's use these analyses to determine the truthfulness of each character:\n\n- Assume A is a truth-teller:\n  - Then, from A's statement, B and C must both be truth-tellers.\n  - If B is a truth-teller, then statement B (\"A is a liar if and only if C is a truth-teller\") creates a contradiction because A cannot be a liar if A is a truth-teller.\n  - Therefore, A cannot be a truth-teller. A must be a liar.\n\n- If A is a liar:\n  - A's statement is false, so either B or C (or both) must be liars.\n  \n- Assume C is a truth-teller:\n  - Then, from C's statement, B would also be a truth-teller.\n  - If B is a truth-teller, statement B (\"A is a liar if and only if C is a truth-teller\") becomes true, consistent with our assumption. This creates no contradictions.\n\n- Therefore, if C is a truth-teller, B is a truth-teller, which matches the condition for A being a liar.\n\nThus, a consistent solution is:\n- A is a liar.\n- B is a truth-teller.\n- C is a truth-teller.\n\nIn conclusion:\nA: liar  \nB: truth-teller  \nC: truth-teller"
