  "prompt": "Assume that there exist only two types of people: truth-tellers and liars. Truth-tellers always tell the truth, while liars always lie.\nYou are given the statements from 3 characters. Based on their statements, infer who is a truth-teller and who is a liar.\n\n\nBased on the following statements, infer who is a truth-teller and who is a liar:\nA: C is a liar if and only if B is a truth-teller.\nB: A is a liar and C is a liar.\nC: A is a liar if and only if B is a truth-teller.\n\nLet's think step by step. First, explain your reasoning. End your answer by clearly stating the identity of each character in the following format:\n\nA: truth-teller/liar\nB: truth-teller/liar\nC: truth-teller/liar",
  "response": "Let's analyze each statement to determine who is a truth-teller and who is a liar.\n\n1. **Consider A's statement: \"C is a liar if and only if B is a truth-teller.\"**\n   - This is a biconditional statement, meaning both parts must have the same truth value for the whole statement to be true.\n\n2. **Consider B's statement: \"A is a liar and C is a liar.\"**\n   - This is a conjunction. For the statement to be true, both conditions must be satisfied; both A and C must be liars.\n\n3. **Consider C's statement: \"A is a liar if and only if B is a truth-teller.\"**\n   - This is also a biconditional statement like A's, meaning that A is a liar and B is a truth-teller must have the same truth value for the statement to be true.\n\nLet's break down the possible cases:\n\n- **Assume A is a truth-teller:**\n  - Then, A's statement \"C is a liar if and only if B is a truth-teller\" must be true.\n  - Therefore, if B is a truth-teller, C must be a liar and vice versa.\n\n  - Now, if B were a truth-teller (under this assumption A is a truth-teller and B must be whatever satisfies A's statement), B's statement \"A is a liar and C is a liar\" would mean A is a liar, contradicting the assumption that A is a truth-teller.\n  - Therefore, B must be a liar if A is a truth-teller. If B is a liar, then B's claim that both A and C are liars is false, meaning at least one of A or C is a truth-teller.\n  - We assumed A is a truth-teller, so C must be a liar. This coincides with A's statement since B (a liar) would indeed determine C (a liar), satisfying A's biconditional truth.\n\n- **Assume B is a truth-teller:**\n  - Then, B's statement \"A is a liar and C is a liar\" must be true.\n  - Therefore, both A and C must be liars.\n  - However, if C is a liar and B is a truth-teller, C's statement \"A is a liar if and only if B is a truth-teller\" should be false. But if B is telling the truth, this would mean A is indeed a liar, which conflicts with C's statement necessarily being false.\n  \n- **Assume C is a truth-teller:**\n  - Then, C's statement \"A is a liar if and only if B is a truth-teller\" must be true.\n  - If B is a truth-teller, then A must be a liar (and vice versa).\n  - If A is truthful, their statement implies B ought to be a liar. Thus, assuming C's veracity leads to A being a liar, meeting C's condition that A is a liar if and only if B is truthful. \n\nThus the consistent assumptions require:\n- A as a truth-teller,\n- B as a liar,\n- C as a liar.\n\nOverall logical deduction based on the statements leads to:\n\nA: truth-teller  \nB: liar  \nC: liar"
