  "prompt": "Assume that there exist only two types of people: truth-tellers and liars. Truth-tellers always tell the truth, while liars always lie.\nYou are given the statements from 3 characters. Based on their statements, infer who is a truth-teller and who is a liar.\n\n\nBased on the following statements, infer who is a truth-teller and who is a liar:\nA: If C is a liar, then B is a liar.\nB: If A is a truth-teller, then C is a truth-teller.\nC: If B is a liar, then A is a truth-teller.\n\nLet's think step by step. First, explain your reasoning. End your answer by clearly stating the identity of each character in the following format:\n\nA: truth-teller/liar\nB: truth-teller/liar\nC: truth-teller/liar",
  "response": "To solve this, we need to establish who is a truth-teller and who is a liar based on their statements.\n\nLet's analyze the statements step-by-step.\n\n1. **Statement A: \"If C is a liar, then B is a liar.\"**\n   - If A is a truth-teller, the statement must be true. Thus, if C is a liar, then B must also be a liar.\n   - If A is a liar, then the statement is false, meaning C could be a liar, and B could be a truth-teller.\n\n2. **Statement B: \"If A is a truth-teller, then C is a truth-teller.\"**\n   - If B is a truth-teller, then if A is a truth-teller, C must also be a truth-teller.\n   - If B is a liar, then the statement is false. Thus, it would be possible for A to be a truth-teller and C a liar.\n\n3. **Statement C: \"If B is a liar, then A is a truth-teller.\"**\n   - If C is a truth-teller, then if B is a liar, A must be a truth-teller.\n   - If C is a liar, the statement is false, meaning B could be a liar and A not a truth-teller.\n\nNow, let's look at potential scenarios:\n\n**Scenario 1: Assume A is a truth-teller.**\n- For A's statement to be true, if C is a liar, then B must also be a liar.\n- For B's statement to be true, as A is assumed a truth-teller, C must also be a truth-teller.\n- A contradiction arises here since C can't be both a truth-teller and a liar.\n\n**Scenario 2: Assume A is a liar.**\n- In this case, A's statement is false, which implies C being a liar and B being a truth-teller is a possibility.\n- For B to be a truth-teller, if A is a liar, there are no restrictions from B on C, except B doesn't confirm C's status.\n- For C's statement, if C is a liar (statement false), then B is a truth-teller and A is a liar, which aligns with our initial assumption.\n\nBased on Scenario 2, this set of truths and lies satisfies all conditions:\n- A is a liar, meaning his statement about B and C doesn't hold.\n- B is a truth-teller, aligned with their statement, as there's no contradiction.\n- C is a liar, making their false statement align since B being a liar and A being a truth-teller is not the case.\n\nThus, the identities are:\n\nA: liar  \nB: truth-teller  \nC: liar"
