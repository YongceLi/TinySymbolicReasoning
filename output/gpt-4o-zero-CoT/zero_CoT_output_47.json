  "prompt": "Assume that there exist only two types of people: truth-tellers and liars. Truth-tellers always tell the truth, while liars always lie.\nYou are given the statements from 3 characters. Based on their statements, infer who is a truth-teller and who is a liar.\n\n\nBased on the following statements, infer who is a truth-teller and who is a liar:\nA: B is a liar and C is a liar.\nB: A is a truth-teller and C is a truth-teller.\nC: B is a truth-teller.\n\nLet's think step by step. First, explain your reasoning. End your answer by clearly stating the identity of each character in the following format:\n\nA: truth-teller/liar\nB: truth-teller/liar\nC: truth-teller/liar",
  "response": "Let's analyze each of the characters' statements and determine who is a truth-teller and who is a liar.\n\n1. **Assume A is a truth-teller:**\n   - If A is telling the truth, then B is a liar and C is a liar.\n   - However, if C is a liar, then their statement that B is a truth-teller would be false, which is consistent with B being a liar.\n   - This scenario is consistent without any contradictions, so it is possible for A to be a truth-teller, B to be a liar, and C to be a liar.\n\n2. **Assume A is a liar:**\n   - If A is lying, then at least one of B or C is not a liar.\n   - Since A says both B and C are liars, this means at least B or C must be a truth-teller.\n   - If B is a truth-teller, A's statement \"B is a liar\" is incorrect, which aligns with A being a liar. But B's statement \"A is a truth-teller\" must then be true, which contradicts B being a truth-teller because A is assumed to be a liar.\n   - If C is a truth-teller, then A\u2019s statement \"C is a liar\" would be false, which is consistent. But then C\u2019s statement \"B is a truth-teller\" must be true, which also contradicts our earlier assumption that B is a liar.\n   - Thus, assuming A is a liar leads to contradictions.\n\nFrom this analysis, the only consistent scenario is when A is a truth-teller, and both B and C are liars.\n\nTherefore, the identities are:\nA: truth-teller  \nB: liar  \nC: liar"
