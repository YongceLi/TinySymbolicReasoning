  "prompt": "Assume that there exist only two types of people: truth-tellers and liars. Truth-tellers always tell the truth, while liars always lie.\nYou are given the statements from 3 characters. Based on their statements, infer who is a truth-teller and who is a liar.\n\n\nBased on the following statements, infer who is a truth-teller and who is a liar:\nA: If B is a liar, then C is a truth-teller.\nB: C is a liar and A is a liar.\nC: A is a truth-teller if and only if B is a liar.\n\nLet's think step by step. First, explain your reasoning. End your answer by clearly stating the identity of each character in the following format:\n\nA: truth-teller/liar\nB: truth-teller/liar\nC: truth-teller/liar",
  "response": "To solve this, we will evaluate the statements for consistency by assuming different scenarios to see which aligns with the rules that truth-tellers consistently tell the truth and liars consistently lie.\n\n1. **Assume A is a truth-teller:**\n   - If A is a truth-teller, then A's statement \"If B is a liar, then C is a truth-teller\" must be true.\n   - This means if B is a liar, C must be a truth-teller.\n   - Now evaluate B's statement: \"C is a liar and A is a liar.\" If B is telling the truth, A's assumption of being a truth-teller is contradicted. Therefore, B must be a liar. \n   - Since B is a liar, B's whole statement is false, meaning it's not true that both C is a liar and A is a liar. It supports that A might be a truth-teller.\n   - Since B is a liar, then by A's truthful statement, C must be a truth-teller.\n   \n2. **Validate C as a truth-teller given B is a liar:**\n   - C's statement is: \"A is a truth-teller if and only if B is a liar.\"\n   - If C is a truth-teller, then this statement must be true.\n   - Since we already assumed and found B to be a liar, C\u2019s statement holds true now if A is indeed a truth-teller (which matches our assumption).\n\nThis scenario is consistent with A and C being truth-tellers, and B being a liar.\n\n3. **Verification with alternative starting assumptions:**\n   - **Assume A is a liar:** \n     - If A is a liar, his statement \"If B is a liar, then C is a truth-teller\" is false. Which implies either B is not a liar or C is not a truth-teller.\n     - B's statement \"C is a liar and A is a liar\" would need to be true if B is a truth-teller, which implies the scenario may hold but relies on C being a liar. However, combining this with C's statement where C would then be lying doesn\u2019t help in sustaining A being a liar.\n     - Makes inconsistencies arise quickly, so proves less viable than first assumption.\n\nUltimately, the consistent solution aligns all characters correctly:\nA: truth-teller\nB: liar\nC: truth-teller"
