  "prompt": "Assume that there exist only two types of people: truth-tellers and liars. Truth-tellers always tell the truth, while liars always lie.\nYou are given the statements from 3 characters. Based on their statements, infer who is a truth-teller and who is a liar.\n\n\nBased on the following statements, infer who is a truth-teller and who is a liar:\nA: C is a truth-teller.\nB: C is a liar.\nC: A is a truth-teller and B is a truth-teller.\n\nLet's think step by step. First, explain your reasoning. End your answer by clearly stating the identity of each character in the following format:\n\nA: truth-teller/liar\nB: truth-teller/liar\nC: truth-teller/liar",
  "response": "To solve this problem, let's analyze each statement:\n\n1. **Assumption**: Let's first assume that C is a truth-teller.\n\n   - If C is a truth-teller, then C's statement \"A is a truth-teller and B is a truth-teller\" must be true. \n   - This means both A and B must also be truth-tellers.\n\n   However, if A is a truth-teller, A's statement \"C is a truth-teller\" is consistent, but B's statement \"C is a liar\" cannot be true since B would have to be a truth-teller based on C's statement. This creates a contradiction because a truth-teller cannot make a false statement.\n\n2. **Conclusion from Assumption**: C cannot be a truth-teller. Therefore, C must be a liar.\n\n3. **Analyze C as a liar**:\n\n   - If C is a liar, then C's statement \"A is a truth-teller and B is a truth-teller\" is false. Thus, at least one of A or B must be a liar. \n\n4. **Evaluate A and B's statements**:\n\n   - If A is a truth-teller, then A's statement \"C is a truth-teller\" must be true, which contradicts our previous conclusion that C is a liar. Therefore, A must be a liar.\n   - If A is a liar, then A's statement \"C is a truth-teller\" is false, which aligns with our conclusion that C is a liar.\n\n   - Finally, if B is a truth-teller, then B's statement \"C is a liar\" is true, which is consistent with C being a liar. This means B can be a truth-teller.\n\nSince all assumptions and checks lead to a consistent conclusion, we have:\n\nA: liar  \nB: truth-teller  \nC: liar"
