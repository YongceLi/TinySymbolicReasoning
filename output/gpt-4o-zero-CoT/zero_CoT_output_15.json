  "prompt": "Assume that there exist only two types of people: truth-tellers and liars. Truth-tellers always tell the truth, while liars always lie.\nYou are given the statements from 3 characters. Based on their statements, infer who is a truth-teller and who is a liar.\n\n\nBased on the following statements, infer who is a truth-teller and who is a liar:\nA: C is a liar.\nB: I am a truth-teller.\nC: A is a truth-teller and B is a truth-teller.\n\nLet's think step by step. First, explain your reasoning. End your answer by clearly stating the identity of each character in the following format:\n\nA: truth-teller/liar\nB: truth-teller/liar\nC: truth-teller/liar",
  "response": "To solve the problem, we need to analyze the statements made by A, B, and C to determine who is a truth-teller and who is a liar.\n\n1. **Assume A is a truth-teller:**\n   - If A is a truth-teller, then A's statement \"C is a liar\" must be true. This means C is a liar.\n   - If C is a liar, then C's statement \"A is a truth-teller and B is a truth-teller\" must be false. Since A is assumed to be a truth-teller, the only way C's statement is false is if B is a liar (because B being a truth-teller would make the statement true).\n\n   Under this assumption:\n   - A is a truth-teller.\n   - B is a liar.\n   - C is a liar.\n\n   This scenario doesn't lead to any contradictions.\n\n2. **Assume A is a liar:**\n   - If A is a liar, then A's statement \"C is a liar\" must be false. Therefore, C must be a truth-teller.\n   - If C is a truth-teller, then C's statement \"A is a truth-teller and B is a truth-teller\" must be true. This means both A and B must be truth-tellers. However, this contradicts our assumption that A is a liar.\n\n   Therefore, this scenario is inconsistent and cannot be true.\n\nBased on this analysis, the only consistent scenario is when:\n- A is a truth-teller.\n- B is a liar.\n- C is a liar.\n\nConclusively, here's the identity of each character:\n\nA: truth-teller\nB: liar\nC: liar"
