  "prompt": "Assume that there exist only two types of people: truth-tellers and liars. Truth-tellers always tell the truth, while liars always lie.\nYou are given the statements from 3 characters. Based on their statements, infer who is a truth-teller and who is a liar.\n\n\nBased on the following statements, infer who is a truth-teller and who is a liar:\nA: C is a liar and B is a truth-teller.\nB: If A is a truth-teller, then C is a truth-teller.\nC: If A is a truth-teller, then B is a liar.\n\nLet's think step by step. First, explain your reasoning. End your answer by clearly stating the identity of each character in the following format:\n\nA: truth-teller/liar\nB: truth-teller/liar\nC: truth-teller/liar",
  "response": "To solve this problem, we need to evaluate each character's statements and determine if they are consistent with telling the truth or lying. Let's go through this step by step.\n\n1. **Consider the possibility that A is a truth-teller:**\n   - If A is a truth-teller, then his statement \"C is a liar and B is a truth-teller\" must be true. This implies:\n     - C is a liar.\n     - B is a truth-teller.\n   - Let's check the consistency of B and C being exactly as described above:\n     - B's statement: \"If A is a truth-teller, then C is a truth-teller.\" If B is a truth-teller, this must be true, which implies C is a truth-teller. There's a contradiction here because we earlier deduced C should be a liar.\n     - Therefore, assuming A is a truth-teller leads to a contradiction. Hence, A cannot be a truth-teller.\n\n2. **Therefore, A must be a liar.**\n   - If A is a liar, then \"C is a liar and B is a truth-teller\" must be false. Therefore:\n     - C is a truth-teller.\n     - B is a liar.\n\n3. **Let's check the consistency of B being a liar and C being a truth-teller:**\n   - B's statement: \"If A is a truth-teller, then C is a truth-teller.\" Since B is a liar, his statement must be false. For it to be false, two possibilities:\n     1. A is a truth-teller and C is a liar (which is not the case as we established A is a liar).\n     2. A is a liar and C is not a truth-teller. But since we established C is a truth-teller, this whole line of reasoning does not apply.\n   - Therefore, another round of reasoning confirms B as a liar, which aligns with our earlier deduction.\n\n4. **C\u2019s statement**: \"If A is a truth-teller, then B is a liar.\" This should be true if C is a truth-teller. Since we've deduced A is definitely not a truth-teller, C\u2019s statement holds true in this setup as such a conditional statement becomes vacuously true when the antecedent is false.\n\nThus, reconciling with the facts:\nA must be a liar, B must be a liar, and C must be a truth-teller.\n\n**Final Answer:**\nA: liar\nB: liar\nC: truth-teller"
