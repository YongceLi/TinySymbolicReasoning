  "prompt": "Assume that there exist only two types of people: truth-tellers and liars. Truth-tellers always tell the truth, while liars always lie.\nYou are given the statements from 3 characters. Based on their statements, infer who is a truth-teller and who is a liar.\n\n\nBased on the following statements, infer who is a truth-teller and who is a liar:\nA: C is a liar and B is a truth-teller.\nB: A is a liar and C is a liar.\nC: A is a liar.\n\nLet's think step by step. First, explain your reasoning. End your answer by clearly stating the identity of each character in the following format:\n\nA: truth-teller/liar\nB: truth-teller/liar\nC: truth-teller/liar",
  "response": "To solve this problem, we'll analyze each character's statements and determine if they can logically be a truth-teller or a liar.\n\n1. **Analyze A's Statement:**\n   - A says: \"C is a liar and B is a truth-teller.\"\n   - If A is a truth-teller, C must be a liar and B must be a truth-teller.\n   - If A is a liar, C is a truth-teller and B is a liar (since the opposite of A's statement would need to be true).\n\n2. **Analyze B's Statement:**\n   - B says: \"A is a liar and C is a liar.\"\n   - If B is a truth-teller, A and C must both be liars.\n   - If B is a liar, A is a truth-teller or C is a truth-teller (since the opposite of B's statement indicates that at least one of them must be a truth-teller).\n\n3. **Analyze C's Statement:**\n   - C says: \"A is a liar.\"\n   - If C is a truth-teller, A must be a liar.\n   - If C is a liar, A must be a truth-teller.\n\nNow let's put these analyses together:\n\n- Assume A is a truth-teller: \n  - Then C must be a liar and B must be a truth-teller. \n  - B's statement would be false (since B would say both A and C are liars, which contradicts A being a truth-teller), which results in a contradiction.\n  - Therefore, A cannot be a truth-teller.\n\n- Assume A is a liar:\n  - C must be a truth-teller and B must be a liar (since the opposite of A's statement indicates this).\n  - C says, \"A is a liar,\" which is consistent with C being a truth-teller.\n  - B says \"A is a liar and C is a liar,\" which is false if C is a truth-teller, consistent with B being a liar.\n\nTherefore, the only consistent scenario is:\n- A is a liar.\n- B is a liar.\n- C is a truth-teller.\n\nFinal identities:\nA: liar  \nB: liar  \nC: truth-teller"
