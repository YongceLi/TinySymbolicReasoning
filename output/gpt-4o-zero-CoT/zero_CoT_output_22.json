  "prompt": "Assume that there exist only two types of people: truth-tellers and liars. Truth-tellers always tell the truth, while liars always lie.\nYou are given the statements from 3 characters. Based on their statements, infer who is a truth-teller and who is a liar.\n\n\nBased on the following statements, infer who is a truth-teller and who is a liar:\nA: C is a truth-teller.\nB: C is a liar and A is a liar.\nC: B is a liar and A is a liar.\n\nLet's think step by step. First, explain your reasoning. End your answer by clearly stating the identity of each character in the following format:\n\nA: truth-teller/liar\nB: truth-teller/liar\nC: truth-teller/liar",
  "response": "To solve this problem, we will analyze the statements logically and determine the identities of A, B, and C.\n\n1. **Consider A's statement: \"C is a truth-teller.\"**\n\n   - If A is a truth-teller, then C must also be a truth-teller.\n   - If A is a liar, then C must be a liar.\n\n2. **Consider B's statement: \"C is a liar and A is a liar.\"**\n\n   - If B is a truth-teller, then both C and A must be liars.\n   - If B is a liar, then at least one of C or A must be a truth-teller.\n\n3. **Consider C's statement: \"B is a liar and A is a liar.\"**\n\n   - If C is a truth-teller, then both B and A must be liars.\n   - If C is a liar, then at least one of B or A must be a truth-teller.\n\nNow, let's use these observations to deduce the identities:\n\n- **Assume A is a truth-teller:**\n  - Then C must be a truth-teller according to A's statement.\n  - If C is a truth-teller, then B must be a liar (from C's statement), which would also make A a liar, leading to a contradiction. Thus, A cannot be a truth-teller.\n\n- **Assume A is a liar:**\n  - Then C must be a liar as well (from A's statement).\n  - If C is a liar, then at least one of B or A must be a truth-teller (C's statement contradicts itself). Since A is already assumed a liar, B must be a truth-teller.\n  - If B is a truth-teller, then both C and A are liars (which matches the assumption and confirms B's statement).\n\nThus, the consistent scenario is:\n\n- A is a liar.\n- B is a truth-teller.\n- C is a liar.\n\nTherefore, the identities are:\n\nA: liar  \nB: truth-teller  \nC: liar"
