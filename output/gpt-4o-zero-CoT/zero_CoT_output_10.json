  "prompt": "Assume that there exist only two types of people: truth-tellers and liars. Truth-tellers always tell the truth, while liars always lie.\nYou are given the statements from 3 characters. Based on their statements, infer who is a truth-teller and who is a liar.\n\n\nBased on the following statements, infer who is a truth-teller and who is a liar:\nA: B is a truth-teller and C is a truth-teller.\nB: C is a truth-teller.\nC: B is a truth-teller and A is a liar.\n\nLet's think step by step. First, explain your reasoning. End your answer by clearly stating the identity of each character in the following format:\n\nA: truth-teller/liar\nB: truth-teller/liar\nC: truth-teller/liar",
  "response": "Let's analyze each statement to determine who is a truth-teller and who is a liar.\n\n1. **Statement A**: \"B is a truth-teller and C is a truth-teller.\"\n   - If A is a truth-teller, then both B and C must be truth-tellers.\n   - If A is a liar, then at least one of B or C is a liar.\n\n2. **Statement B**: \"C is a truth-teller.\"\n   - If B is a truth-teller, then C must also be a truth-teller.\n   - If B is a liar, then C must be a liar.\n\n3. **Statement C**: \"B is a truth-teller and A is a liar.\"\n   - If C is a truth-teller, then B is a truth-teller and A is a liar.\n   - If C is a liar, then B is a liar or A is a truth-teller.\n\nLet's consider each case:\n\n- **Assume A is a truth-teller**:\n  - From A's statement, both B and C are truth-tellers.\n  - However, this contradicts C's statement which claims A is a liar. C cannot be both a truth-teller and a liar at the same time.\n\n- **Assume A is a liar**:\n  - Then according to A's statement, at least one of B or C is a liar.\n  - Check B's statement: If B is a truth-teller, then C is a truth-teller.\n  - Check C's statement: If C is a truth-teller, then B is a truth-teller and A is a liar.\n  - So, if C is a truth-teller, this statement aligns with A being a liar, which is consistent.\n\nThus, if A is a liar, B is a truth-teller, and C is a truth-teller. This combination does not contain any contradictions.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nA: liar  \nB: truth-teller  \nC: truth-teller"
