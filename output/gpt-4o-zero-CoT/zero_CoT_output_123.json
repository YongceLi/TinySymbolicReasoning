  "prompt": "Assume that there exist only two types of people: truth-tellers and liars. Truth-tellers always tell the truth, while liars always lie.\nYou are given the statements from 3 characters. Based on their statements, infer who is a truth-teller and who is a liar.\n\n\nBased on the following statements, infer who is a truth-teller and who is a liar:\nA: If B is a liar, then C is a truth-teller.\nB: If A is a truth-teller, then C is a liar.\nC: If B is a truth-teller, then A is a truth-teller.\n\nLet's think step by step. First, explain your reasoning. End your answer by clearly stating the identity of each character in the following format:\n\nA: truth-teller/liar\nB: truth-teller/liar\nC: truth-teller/liar",
  "response": "To determine who is a truth-teller and who is a liar, let's analyze the statements:\n\n1. **A's statement:** \"If B is a liar, then C is a truth-teller.\"\n   \n   - If A is a truth-teller, then this statement should be true. This means if B is indeed a liar, C must be a truth-teller.\n   - If A is a liar, the statement is false. Therefore, if B is a liar, C cannot be a truth-teller; meaning C must also be a liar.\n\n2. **B's statement:** \"If A is a truth-teller, then C is a liar.\"\n\n   - If B is a truth-teller, then this statement is true. This means if A is a truth-teller, C must be a liar.\n   - If B is a liar, the statement is false. This means if A is a truth-teller, C must be a truth-teller, which contradicts B's assumption of lying.\n\n3. **C's statement:** \"If B is a truth-teller, then A is a truth-teller.\"\n\n   - If C is a truth-teller, then this statement is true. This means if B is a truth-teller, A must also be a truth-teller.\n   - If C is a liar, the statement is false. Therefore, if B is a truth-teller, A cannot be a truth-teller; meaning A must be a liar.\n\nLet's explore possible scenarios:\n\n- Assume A is a truth-teller:\n  - A's statement is true: \"If B is a liar, then C is a truth-teller.\"\n  - B's statement must be evaluated: \"If A is a truth-teller, then C is a liar.\" This must be false (because B is a liar for consistency), so C must be a truth-teller.\n  - For C to be a truth-teller, B cannot be a truth-teller (as per B's statement), thus B must be a liar.\n  - C's statement: \"If B is a truth-teller, then A is a truth-teller.\" B is not a truth-teller, so the statement does not affect consistency.\n\n- Assume A is a liar:\n  - A's statement is false: so \"If B is a liar, then C is a truth-teller.\" becomes \"B is a liar and C is a liar.\"\n  - If B is a liar, B's statement \"If A is a truth-teller, then C is a liar.\" becomes false, thus C must be a truth-teller.\n  - Contradiction arises here because for A lying to make sense, C must be a liar, yet we concluded C must be a truth-teller.\n\nThis underscores that A cannot be a liar and C a truth-teller at the same time, contradicting our assumptions. \n\nThus, the only logical distribution is:\n- A is a truth-teller.\n- B is a liar.\n- C is a truth-teller.\n\nVerification:\n- A is a truth-teller: \"If B is a liar (true), then C is a truth-teller (true).\" True statement.\n- B is a liar: \"If A is a truth-teller (true), then C is a liar (false).\" False statement expected from a liar.\n- C is a truth-teller: \"If B is a truth-teller (false), then A is a truth-teller (true).\" Statement remains True.\n\nThus, the distribution holds consistently:\n\nA: truth-teller  \nB: liar  \nC: truth-teller"
