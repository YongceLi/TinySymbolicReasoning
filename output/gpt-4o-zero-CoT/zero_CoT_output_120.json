  "prompt": "Assume that there exist only two types of people: truth-tellers and liars. Truth-tellers always tell the truth, while liars always lie.\nYou are given the statements from 3 characters. Based on their statements, infer who is a truth-teller and who is a liar.\n\n\nBased on the following statements, infer who is a truth-teller and who is a liar:\nA: B is a liar.\nB: C is a truth-teller and A is a truth-teller.\nC: A is a liar.\n\nLet's think step by step. First, explain your reasoning. End your answer by clearly stating the identity of each character in the following format:\n\nA: truth-teller/liar\nB: truth-teller/liar\nC: truth-teller/liar",
  "response": "To determine who is a truth-teller and who is a liar, let's examine each statement:\n\n1. A: B is a liar.\n2. B: C is a truth-teller and A is a truth-teller.\n3. C: A is a liar.\n\nLet's analyze these step-by-step:\n\n- Start by assuming A is a truth-teller:\n  - If A is telling the truth, then B must be a liar (based on A's statement).\n  - If B is a liar, his statement that \"C is a truth-teller and A is a truth-teller\" must be false.\n  - Since B claims C is a truth-teller, and we know B is lying, C must be a liar.\n  - If C is a liar, then C's statement that \"A is a liar\" must be false, meaning A is indeed a truth-teller.\n  - This scenario is consistent: A is a truth-teller, B is a liar, and C is a liar.\n\n- Try assuming A is a liar:\n  - If A is lying, then B must be a truth-teller (since A said B is a liar).\n  - If B is a truth-teller, his statement that \"C is a truth-teller and A is a truth-teller\" must be true.\n  - This contradicts our assumption that A is a liar.\n  - Therefore, assuming A is a liar leads to a contradiction.\n\nSince assuming A is a liar leads to a contradiction, the only consistent scenario is:\n\nA: truth-teller  \nB: liar  \nC: liar"
