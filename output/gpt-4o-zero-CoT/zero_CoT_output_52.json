  "prompt": "Assume that there exist only two types of people: truth-tellers and liars. Truth-tellers always tell the truth, while liars always lie.\nYou are given the statements from 3 characters. Based on their statements, infer who is a truth-teller and who is a liar.\n\n\nBased on the following statements, infer who is a truth-teller and who is a liar:\nA: B is a truth-teller if and only if C is a liar.\nB: C is a liar.\nC: A is a liar and B is a truth-teller.\n\nLet's think step by step. First, explain your reasoning. End your answer by clearly stating the identity of each character in the following format:\n\nA: truth-teller/liar\nB: truth-teller/liar\nC: truth-teller/liar",
  "response": "To determine who is a truth-teller and who is a liar, let's analyze the statements of each person step by step.\n\n1. **Analyzing A's Statement:**\n   - A says, \"B is a truth-teller if and only if C is a liar.\" This means if A is a truth-teller:\n     - Both B's truth-telling and C's lying must be true at the same time, which can only happen if B is a truth-teller and C is a liar.\n\n2. **Analyzing B's Statement:**\n   - B says, \"C is a liar.\" If B is a truth-teller, this statement is true, meaning C must be a liar.\n\n3. **Analyzing C's Statement:**\n   - C says, \"A is a liar and B is a truth-teller.\" If C is a truth-teller, this statement must be true, which contradicts C being a liar, breaking the assumption. Therefore, if C is truthful, both parts should be true, and C claims A is a liar. \n   - However, if C is a liar, then both parts of this statement should be false. This contradicts itself, since C calling B a truth-teller would turn this statement into a truth if B were truthful.\n\nLet's evaluate logical conclusions:\n\n- Assume **A is a truth-teller**:\n  - From A's statement, if B is a truth-teller, then C must be a liar, which aligns with B's statement. \n  - B said C is a liar, which aligns with the assumption that A is truthful.\n\n- Assume **B is a truth-teller**:\n  - According to B, C is a liar, which fits our assumption.\n  - If B is a truth-teller, from A's statement, C would also be a liar, and A would be a truth-teller.\n\n- Assume **C is a truth-teller**:\n  - C's statement claims A is a liar and B a truth-teller, forming a contradiction because if B is truthful, C can't be a truth-teller.\n\nFrom these assumptions and deductions:\n- If B and C's observations are consistent, C can\u2019t consistently remain truthful without conflicting internally.\n- Therefore, C must be a liar; this makes A's conditions for B's truthfulness hold true.\n\nThus, the configuration that fits all is:\n- A is a truth-teller.\n- B is a truth-teller.\n- C is a liar.\n\nConclusively:\nA: truth-teller\nB: truth-teller\nC: liar"
