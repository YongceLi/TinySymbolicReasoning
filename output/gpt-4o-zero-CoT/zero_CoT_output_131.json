  "prompt": "Assume that there exist only two types of people: truth-tellers and liars. Truth-tellers always tell the truth, while liars always lie.\nYou are given the statements from 3 characters. Based on their statements, infer who is a truth-teller and who is a liar.\n\n\nBased on the following statements, infer who is a truth-teller and who is a liar:\nA: If C is a truth-teller, then B is a truth-teller.\nB: C is a truth-teller if and only if A is a truth-teller.\nC: If B is a truth-teller, then A is a liar.\n\nLet's think step by step. First, explain your reasoning. End your answer by clearly stating the identity of each character in the following format:\n\nA: truth-teller/liar\nB: truth-teller/liar\nC: truth-teller/liar",
  "response": "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the statements made by A, B, and C and determine their truthfulness. Let's break down each statement and see if we can find any contradictions to identify who is a truth-teller and who is a liar.\n\n1. **Statement by A**: \"If C is a truth-teller, then B is a truth-teller.\"\n   - This is a conditional statement. The only time this statement is false is if C is a truth-teller and B is a liar. \n\n2. **Statement by B**: \"C is a truth-teller if and only if A is a truth-teller.\"\n   - This is a biconditional statement, meaning both C and A must have the same truth value. Either both are truth-tellers or both are liars.\n\n3. **Statement by C**: \"If B is a truth-teller, then A is a liar.\"\n   - This is another conditional statement. It will be false only if B is a truth-teller and A is also a truth-teller.\n\nLet's consider different scenarios based on these statements:\n\n- **Assume A is a truth-teller**:\n  - A is telling the truth, so if C is a truth-teller, then B must be a truth-teller.\n  - If A is a truth-teller, then according to B's statement, C must also be a truth-teller. Thus, C is a truth-teller and consequently B is a truth-teller.\n  - However, if B is a truth-teller, then C's statement means that A must be a liar, which contradicts our assumption that A is a truth-teller.\n  - Therefore, this scenario leads to a contradiction. A cannot be a truth-teller.\n\n- **Assume A is a liar**:\n  - If A is a liar, then A's statement \"If C is a truth-teller, then B is a truth-teller\" is false. This implies that C is a truth-teller and B is a liar.\n  - If B is a liar, B's statement \"C is a truth-teller if and only if A is a truth-teller\" is false. This implies that C is not a truth-teller if A is not a truth-teller, which is consistent since A is a liar and C is a truth-teller.\n  - If C is a truth-teller, then his statement \"If B is a truth-teller, then A is a liar\" needs to be true. Since B is indeed a liar, this statement holds.\n  - Hence, there are no contradictions in this scenario.\n\nBased on this analysis, we conclude that:\n\nA: liar  \nB: liar  \nC: truth-teller  "
