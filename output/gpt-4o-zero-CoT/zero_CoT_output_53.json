  "prompt": "Assume that there exist only two types of people: truth-tellers and liars. Truth-tellers always tell the truth, while liars always lie.\nYou are given the statements from 3 characters. Based on their statements, infer who is a truth-teller and who is a liar.\n\n\nBased on the following statements, infer who is a truth-teller and who is a liar:\nA: C is a liar and B is a truth-teller.\nB: C is a truth-teller.\nC: A is a truth-teller.\n\nLet's think step by step. First, explain your reasoning. End your answer by clearly stating the identity of each character in the following format:\n\nA: truth-teller/liar\nB: truth-teller/liar\nC: truth-teller/liar",
  "response": "To determine who is a truth-teller and who is a liar, we will examine each possible scenario and ensure consistency with the characters' statements.\n\n1. **Assume A is a truth-teller:**\n   - If A is a truth-teller, then A's statement \"C is a liar and B is a truth-teller\" must be true.\n   - This implies C is a liar and B is a truth-teller.\n\n   - If B is a truth-teller, then B's statement \"C is a truth-teller\" must also be true.\n     - However, this creates a contradiction because A stated that C is a liar. Thus, A cannot be a truth-teller.\n\n2. **Assume A is a liar:**\n   - If A is lying, then the statement \"C is a liar and B is a truth-teller\" is false.\n   - Therefore, either C is a truth-teller or B is a liar, or both conditions are possible.\n\nNow, consider the cases under this assumption:\n\n- If B is a liar (since A is lying about B being a truth-teller), then B's statement \"C is a truth-teller\" is false.\n  - This implies that C must be a liar.\n\n- If C is a liar, this contradicts A's initial statement (truth-telling assumption), which is fine under the assumption that A is a liar.\n\nThus, with A as a liar:\n- B is a liar (opposite of A's false claim that B is a truth-teller).\n- C, being falsely claimed as a liar by A (and simultaneously, B's false claim that C is a truth-teller), should be a truth-teller.\n\nThis makes B and A consistent as liars while C remains consistent as a truth-teller.\n\nTherefore, the identities are:\n\nA: liar  \nB: liar  \nC: truth-teller  "
