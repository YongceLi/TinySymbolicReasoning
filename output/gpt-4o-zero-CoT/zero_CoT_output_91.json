  "prompt": "Assume that there exist only two types of people: truth-tellers and liars. Truth-tellers always tell the truth, while liars always lie.\nYou are given the statements from 3 characters. Based on their statements, infer who is a truth-teller and who is a liar.\n\n\nBased on the following statements, infer who is a truth-teller and who is a liar:\nA: B is a truth-teller if and only if C is a truth-teller.\nB: If A is a truth-teller, then C is a truth-teller.\nC: If A is a liar, then B is a truth-teller.\n\nLet's think step by step. First, explain your reasoning. End your answer by clearly stating the identity of each character in the following format:\n\nA: truth-teller/liar\nB: truth-teller/liar\nC: truth-teller/liar",
  "response": "To solve this problem, let's analyze the statements step by step while considering the roles of truth-tellers and liars.\n\n1. **Evaluate A's statement: \"B is a truth-teller if and only if C is a truth-teller.\"**\n   - If A is a truth-teller, then for A's statement to be true, either both B and C are truth-tellers, or both are liars.\n   - If A is a liar, then B and C must be opposite in truth value (i.e., one is a truth-teller and the other is a liar).\n\n2. **Evaluate B's statement: \"If A is a truth-teller, then C is a truth-teller.\"**\n   - If B is a truth-teller, then whenever A is a truth-teller, C must also be a truth-teller.\n   - If B is a liar, then if A is a truth-teller, C must be a liar (or A is a liar for the implication to be irrelevant).\n\n3. **Evaluate C's statement: \"If A is a liar, then B is a truth-teller.\"**\n   - If C is a truth-teller, then whenever A is a liar, B must be a truth-teller.\n   - If C is a liar, then if A is a liar, B must be a liar (or A must be a truth-teller for the implication to be irrelevant).\n\nNow, let's reason through the possibilities:\n\n- **Assume A is a truth-teller:**\n  - According to A's statement, B and C must both be truth-tellers or both be liars.\n  - If B tells the truth, C must be a truth-teller (as per B's statement).\n  - If C tells the truth, B must be a truth-teller if A is a liar (which is a contradiction since we assume A is a truth-teller).\n  - Therefore, if A is a truth-teller, B must be a liar and C must be a liar, which contradicts A's statement.\n\n- **Assume A is a liar:**\n  - A's statement being false implies B and C must have opposite truth values.\n  - Consider B could be a truth-teller:\n    - B's statement: If A is a truth-teller, C must be a truth-teller, is irrelevant since A is a liar. Thus, B can be a truth-teller.\n    - C's statement being a liar is consistent, as if A is a liar, B must be a truth-teller (since C is lying).\n  - Therefore, B can be a truth-teller and C a liar is consistent.\n\nGiven these findings, the only consistent assignment is:\n- A is a liar.\n- B is a truth-teller.\n- C is a liar.\n\nThus, the solution is:\nA: liar\nB: truth-teller\nC: liar"
