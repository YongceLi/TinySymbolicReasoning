  "prompt": "Assume that there exist only two types of people: truth-tellers and liars. Truth-tellers always tell the truth, while liars always lie.\nYou are given the statements from 3 characters. Based on their statements, infer who is a truth-teller and who is a liar.\n\n\nBased on the following statements, infer who is a truth-teller and who is a liar:\nA: C is a liar.\nB: A is a truth-teller and C is a liar.\nC: A is a liar and B is a truth-teller.\n\nLet's think step by step. First, explain your reasoning. End your answer by clearly stating the identity of each character in the following format:\n\nA: truth-teller/liar\nB: truth-teller/liar\nC: truth-teller/liar",
  "response": "To solve this problem, we'll analyze each character's statements one by one while considering the implications of each being a truth-teller or a liar. Let's go step by step:\n\n1. **Analyze A's Statement:**\n   - A says, \"C is a liar.\"\n   - If A is a truth-teller, then C must be a liar.\n   - If A is a liar, then C is actually a truth-teller.\n\n2. **Analyze B's Statement:**\n   - B says, \"A is a truth-teller and C is a liar.\"\n   - If B is a truth-teller, both parts of the statement must be true: A is a truth-teller and C is a liar.\n   - If B is a liar, at least one part of the statement must be false. So, either A is a liar or C is a truth-teller (or both).\n\n3. **Analyze C's Statement:**\n   - C says, \"A is a liar and B is a truth-teller.\"\n   - If C is a truth-teller, then A is a liar and B is a truth-teller.\n   - If C is a liar, then A is a truth-teller or B is a liar (or both).\n\n**Now consider possible scenarios:**\n\n- **Assume A is a truth-teller:**\n  - Then C is a liar (from A's statement).\n  - If C is a liar, then C's statement is false, which means A is not a liar (consistent) and B is not a truth-teller.\n  - Therefore, B is a liar.\n\n  This scenario works:\n  - A is a truth-teller.\n  - B is a liar.\n  - C is a liar.\n\n- **Assume A is a liar:**\n  - Then C is a truth-teller (from A's statement being false).\n  - If C is a truth-teller, then C's statement is true: A is a liar, and B is a truth-teller.\n  - Thus, B is a truth-teller, consistent with the assumption that A is a liar.\n  \n  This scenario contradicts B's own statement because, as B is a truth-teller, his whole statement must be true, which means A should be a truth-teller and not a liar.\n\nSince the scenario where A is a liar leads to a contradiction with B being a truth-teller, the only consistent scenario is A being a truth-teller, leading to:\n\nA: truth-teller  \nB: liar  \nC: liar  "
