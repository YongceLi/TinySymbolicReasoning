  "prompt": "Assume that there exist only two types of people: truth-tellers and liars. Truth-tellers always tell the truth, while liars always lie.\nYou are given the statements from 3 characters. Based on their statements, infer who is a truth-teller and who is a liar.\n\n\nBased on the following statements, infer who is a truth-teller and who is a liar:\nA: C is a truth-teller.\nB: C is a liar and A is a truth-teller.\nC: If B is a truth-teller, then A is a liar.\n\nLet's think step by step. First, explain your reasoning. End your answer by clearly stating the identity of each character in the following format:\n\nA: truth-teller/liar\nB: truth-teller/liar\nC: truth-teller/liar",
  "response": "Let's analyze the given statements step by step:\n\n1. **A's statement**: \"C is a truth-teller.\"\n   - If A is a truth-teller, then C must be a truth-teller.\n   - If A is a liar, then C must be a liar.\n\n2. **B's statement**: \"C is a liar and A is a truth-teller.\"\n   - If B is a truth-teller, then C must be a liar and A must be a truth-teller.\n   - If B is a liar, then either C is not a liar or A is not a truth-teller (or both).\n\n3. **C's statement**: \"If B is a truth-teller, then A is a liar.\"\n   - If C is a truth-teller, then if B is a truth-teller, A must be a liar.\n   - If C is a liar, then the statement inconsistency means B could be a truth-teller and A could be a truth-teller.\n\nLet's explore possible scenarios logically:\n\n### Scenario 1: Assume A is a truth-teller.\n- From A's statement, C must also be a truth-teller.\n- However, if C is a truth-teller, then according to C's statement, if B is a truth-teller, A is supposed to be a liar, which contradicts our assumption. \n- Therefore, A cannot be a truth-teller.\n\n### Scenario 2: Assume A is a liar.\n- C must be a liar because A, being a liar, falsely claims C is a truth-teller.\n- If C is a liar, then C's statement \"if B is a truth-teller, then A is a liar\" can be ignored for its direct truth value. B's truth status remains open to our assumption. \n\nNow let's check if B is a truth-teller:\n- If B is a truth-teller, then:\n  - According to B\u2019s statement \"C is a liar and A is a truth-teller,\" our assumption about A (liar) contradicts B's statement, so B cannot be a truth-teller.\n\nLet's assume B is a liar:\n- If B is a liar, then at least one part of B's statement \"C is a liar and A is a truth-teller\" is false:\n  - C is a liar aligns with B being a liar.\n  - A is not a truth-teller (which confirms our assumed state of A being a liar). \n\nTherefore, the arrangement where A and B are liars and C is a liar stands logically consistent, but we've already identified a contradiction. Let's reject our falsified assumption about B\u2019s state.\n\nFinalize:\n- A is a liar and fits with neither claiming truth latterly.\n- C is a liar by A\u2019s wrong claim.\n- B\u2019s true state accommodates and fits with distinguished C opposite as required.\n\n**Final determination**:\nA: liar  \nB: truth-teller  \nC: liar  "
