  "prompt": "Assume that there exist only two types of people: truth-tellers and liars. Truth-tellers always tell the truth, while liars always lie.\nYou are given the statements from 3 characters. Based on their statements, infer who is a truth-teller and who is a liar.\n\n\nBased on the following statements, infer who is a truth-teller and who is a liar:\nA: B is a truth-teller.\nB: If C is a liar, then A is a liar.\nC: B is a liar if and only if A is a liar.\n\nLet's think step by step. First, explain your reasoning. End your answer by clearly stating the identity of each character in the following format:\n\nA: truth-teller/liar\nB: truth-teller/liar\nC: truth-teller/liar",
  "response": "Let's analyze each statement and infer the identities step by step:\n\n1. **Statement by A**: \"B is a truth-teller.\"\n   - If A is a truth-teller, then B must indeed be a truth-teller.\n   - If A is a liar, then B must be a liar.\n\n2. **Statement by B**: \"If C is a liar, then A is a liar.\"\n   - This is equivalent to saying if B is a truth-teller, then whenever C is a liar, A is also a liar.\n   - If B is a liar, the statement is false, which would mean that there is a scenario where C is a liar and A is a truth-teller.\n\n3. **Statement by C**: \"B is a liar if and only if A is a liar.\"\n   - This means B and A have the same truth value. They are both truth-tellers, or both liars.\n   - If C is a truth-teller, this statement is true, meaning A and B share the same status.\n   - If C is a liar, this statement is false, meaning A and B have different statuses.\n\nNow, let's consider the possibilities:\n\n- **Assume A is a truth-teller**:\n  - Then B must be a truth-teller (from A's statement).\n  - If B is a truth-teller, then the statement \"If C is a liar, then A is a liar\" holds, and this does not contradict any assumption.\n  - Considering C's statement: \"B is a liar if and only if A is a liar,\" to be true, C can be either truth-teller or liar but from the assumptions we narrowed down that A and B are truth-tellers, hence C must be a liar to make sure they cannot share the same status (same truthfulness).\n\n- **Assume A is a liar**:\n  - Then B must be a liar (from A's statement).\n  - If B is a liar, then B's statement would not hold, meaning there would be a case where C is a liar and A is a truth-teller, which contradicts our assumption that A is a liar.\n  \nTherefore, assuming A is a liar leads to a contradiction, so the only consistent scenario is when:\n\nA: truth-teller\nB: truth-teller\nC: liar"
