  "prompt": "Assume that there exist only two types of people: truth-tellers and liars. Truth-tellers always tell the truth, while liars always lie.\nYou are given the statements from 3 characters. Based on their statements, infer who is a truth-teller and who is a liar.\n\n\nBased on the following statements, infer who is a truth-teller and who is a liar:\nA: C is a liar and B is a truth-teller.\nB: C is a truth-teller.\nC: A is a liar.\n\nLet's think step by step. First, explain your reasoning. End your answer by clearly stating the identity of each character in the following format:\n\nA: truth-teller/liar\nB: truth-teller/liar\nC: truth-teller/liar",
  "response": "To solve this problem, we'll analyze each statement considering the known nature of truth-tellers and liars. \n\n### Analyzing Statements:\n\n1. **Assuming A is a truth-teller:**\n   - A: \"C is a liar and B is a truth-teller.\"\n     - If A is telling the truth, then:\n       - C must be a liar.\n       - B must be a truth-teller.\n\n   - Check B's statement: \"C is a truth-teller.\"\n     - If B is a truth-teller, this statement is true, which contradicts A's statement that C is a liar.\n     - Therefore, this assumption is inconsistent.\n\n2. **Assuming A is a liar:**\n   - A's statement: \"C is a liar and B is a truth-teller.\"\n     - If A is lying, then either C is a truth-teller, or B is a liar, or both.\n\n   - Re-evaluate B's statement under these conditions:\n     - B: \"C is a truth-teller.\"\n     - If B is lying, then C must be a liar. This is consistent with A being a liar if both C is a truth-teller and B is a liar.\n     - If B is a truth-teller (original assumption from A being a liar is that B is a liar, so we ignore this possibility).\n\n   - Check C's statement: \"A is a liar.\"\n     - If C is a truth-teller, this statement must be true, which is consistent with our assumption that A is indeed a liar.\n\n### Final Conclusion:\n- With A as a liar, C must be telling the truth for their statement to hold. Consequently, A is a liar, and C is a truth-teller.\n- B's statement doesn't hold under truth-teller assumption (conflict with C), hence B must be a liar.\n\n**Result:**\n- A: liar\n- B: liar\n- C: truth-teller"
