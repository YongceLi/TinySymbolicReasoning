  "prompt": "Assume that there exist only two types of people: truth-tellers and liars. Truth-tellers always tell the truth, while liars always lie.\nYou are given the statements from 3 characters. Based on their statements, infer who is a truth-teller and who is a liar.\n\n\nBased on the following statements, infer who is a truth-teller and who is a liar:\nA: C is a liar.\nB: C is a truth-teller and A is a truth-teller.\nC: B is a truth-teller.\n\nLet's think step by step. First, explain your reasoning. End your answer by clearly stating the identity of each character in the following format:\n\nA: truth-teller/liar\nB: truth-teller/liar\nC: truth-teller/liar",
  "response": "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the statements given by A, B, and C, under the premise that each is either a truth-teller or a liar.\n\n1. **Analyzing A's statement: \"C is a liar.\"**\n   - If A is a truth-teller, then C must indeed be a liar.\n   - If A is a liar, then C must be a truth-teller (since liars always lie).\n\n2. **Analyzing B's statement: \"C is a truth-teller and A is a truth-teller.\"**\n   - If B is a truth-teller, then both C and A must be truth-tellers.\n   - If B is a liar, then at least one part of his statement is false. This means either C is not a truth-teller or A is not a truth-teller (or both).\n\n3. **Analyzing C's statement: \"B is a truth-teller.\"**\n   - If C is a truth-teller, then B must be a truth-teller.\n   - If C is a liar, then B must be a liar.\n\nLet's explore each possibility:\n\n- **Assume A is a truth-teller:**\n  - Then C must be a liar (from A's statement).\n  - If C is a liar, then from C's statement, B is a liar.\n  - Hence, in this scenario: A = truth-teller, B = liar, and C = liar.\n  - This configuration is consistent with all their statements.\n\n- **Assume A is a liar:**\n  - Then C must be a truth-teller.\n  - If C is a truth-teller, then from C's statement, B must be a truth-teller.\n  - However, B said both A and C are truth-tellers, which is false if A is a liar.\n  - This leads to a contradiction, as B cannot be a truth-teller if A is a liar.\n\nThus, the only consistent scenario is where A is a truth-teller, B is a liar, and C is a liar.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nA: truth-teller  \nB: liar  \nC: liar"
