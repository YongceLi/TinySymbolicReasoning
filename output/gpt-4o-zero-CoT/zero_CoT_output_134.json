  "prompt": "Assume that there exist only two types of people: truth-tellers and liars. Truth-tellers always tell the truth, while liars always lie.\nYou are given the statements from 3 characters. Based on their statements, infer who is a truth-teller and who is a liar.\n\n\nBased on the following statements, infer who is a truth-teller and who is a liar:\nA: If C is a liar, then B is a truth-teller.\nB: C is a liar.\nC: If A is a liar, then B is a truth-teller.\n\nLet's think step by step. First, explain your reasoning. End your answer by clearly stating the identity of each character in the following format:\n\nA: truth-teller/liar\nB: truth-teller/liar\nC: truth-teller/liar",
  "response": "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the statements made by each character and determine who is telling the truth and who is lying.\n\n1. **Statement by A**: \"If C is a liar, then B is a truth-teller.\"\n   - If A is telling the truth, then the whole statement is true. This means that if C is a liar, B must be a truth-teller.\n   - If A is lying, the implication \"If C is a liar, then B is a truth-teller\" must be false. This implies that C is a liar and B is a liar.\n\n2. **Statement by B**: \"C is a liar.\"\n   - If B is telling the truth, then C indeed is a liar.\n   - If B is lying, then C is not a liar, meaning C is a truth-teller.\n\n3. **Statement by C**: \"If A is a liar, then B is a truth-teller.\"\n   - If C is telling the truth, then the implication holds: if A is a liar, then B must be a truth-teller.\n   - If C is lying, the implication is false. This would mean that A is a liar and B is not a truth-teller (i.e., B is a liar).\n\nNow, let's test possible scenarios:\n\n### Scenario 1: Assume A is a truth-teller\n- Then A's statement is true: If C is a liar, then B is a truth-teller.\n- Consider B's statement: If B is a truth-teller, then B's statement \"C is a liar\" is true, so C is a liar.\n- However, if C is a liar, then C's statement should be false. So \"If A is a liar, then B is a truth-teller\" should be false. But we assumed A is a truth-teller, leading to a contradiction.\n- Therefore, A cannot be a truth-teller.\n\n### Scenario 2: Assume A is a liar\n- Then A's statement is false: \"If C is a liar, then B is a truth-teller\" is false.\n- This means that C is a liar, but B is not a truth-teller (i.e., B is a liar).\n- Consider B's statement: Since B is a liar, B's statement \"C is a liar\" is false, meaning C is a truth-teller.\n- This matches our earlier finding (C is a truth-teller).\n\nTherefore, if A is a liar, then both A and B are liars, and C is a truth-teller.\n\nSo, the identities are:\nA: liar  \nB: liar  \nC: truth-teller"
