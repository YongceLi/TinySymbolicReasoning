  "prompt": "Assume that there exist only two types of people: truth-tellers and liars. Truth-tellers always tell the truth, while liars always lie.\nYou are given the statements from 3 characters. Based on their statements, infer who is a truth-teller and who is a liar.\n\n\nBased on the following statements, infer who is a truth-teller and who is a liar:\nA: C is a truth-teller and B is a liar.\nB: A is a truth-teller and C is a truth-teller.\nC: I am a truth-teller.\n\nLet's think step by step. First, explain your reasoning. End your answer by clearly stating the identity of each character in the following format:\n\nA: truth-teller/liar\nB: truth-teller/liar\nC: truth-teller/liar",
  "response": "To solve this problem, we need to evaluate the consistency of each character's statements and identify contradictions.\n\n1. **Analyze C's statement:**  \n   - C claims to be a truth-teller.\n   - If C is a truth-teller, then C's statement is true. Therefore, C must indeed be a truth-teller. \n   - If C is a liar, then C's statement is false, meaning C is lying about being a truth-teller, confirming C is a liar.\n\n2. **Consider the possibilities for C:**\n   - **If C is a truth-teller:**\n     - According to A: C is a truth-teller (which is consistent), but B is a liar.\n     - According to B: A is a truth-teller and C is a truth-teller. However, B says A is a truth-teller which contradicts A's statement about B. So B's statement cannot hold if C is a truth-teller.\n\n   - **If C is a liar:**\n     - Based on A's statement, if A is telling the truth, then C is indeed not a truth-teller (consistent with C being a liar), but B must be a liar.\n     - If B is a truth-teller, according to B: A is a truth-teller and C is a truth-teller, which contradicts C being a liar.\n\n3. **Resolve by contradiction:**\n   - Assume C is a truth-teller. Then by B's statement, A must also be a truth-teller, which contradicts A's claim that B is a liar.\n   - Therefore, C cannot be a truth-teller.\n\nConsidering all possibilities and contradictions, we deduce:\n\n- C must be a liar (since assuming C is a truth-teller leads to contradiction).\n- If C is a liar, A's statement \"C is a truth-teller and B is a liar\" is partly correct regarding B being a liar.\n- Hence, A must be a truth-teller.\n- B is then determined to be the liar because both A's claim and failure of B's statements corroborates this.\n\nThus, the identities are:\n\nA: truth-teller  \nB: liar  \nC: liar"
