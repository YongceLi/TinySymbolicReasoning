  "prompt": "Assume that there exist only two types of people: truth-tellers and liars. Truth-tellers always tell the truth, while liars always lie.\nYou are given the statements from 3 characters. Based on their statements, infer who is a truth-teller and who is a liar.\n\n\nBased on the following statements, infer who is a truth-teller and who is a liar:\nA: C is a truth-teller and B is a liar.\nB: A is a liar.\nC: B is a truth-teller.\n\nLet's think step by step. First, explain your reasoning. End your answer by clearly stating the identity of each character in the following format:\n\nA: truth-teller/liar\nB: truth-teller/liar\nC: truth-teller/liar",
  "response": "To solve this problem, we must evaluate each statement considering the two possible identities (truth-teller or liar) for each character.\n\n1. Consider A's statement: \"C is a truth-teller and B is a liar.\"\n   - If A is a truth-teller, then C must be a truth-teller and B must be a liar.\n   - If A is a liar, then at least one part of the statement must be false, meaning either C is not a truth-teller or B is not a liar.\n\n2. Consider B's statement: \"A is a liar.\"\n   - If B is a truth-teller, then A must be a liar.\n   - If B is a liar, then A must be a truth-teller.\n\n3. Consider C's statement: \"B is a truth-teller.\"\n   - If C is a truth-teller, then B must be a truth-teller.\n   - If C is a liar, then B must be a liar.\n\nNow, let's analyze the possible scenarios:\n\n- If A is a truth-teller:\n  - C must be a truth-teller and B must be a liar (according to A's statement).\n  - However, C being a truth-teller would mean B must be a truth-teller (according to C's statement), which is a contradiction.\n\n- If A is a liar:\n  - At least one part of A's statement is false, meaning C is not a truth-teller or B is not a liar.\n  - Since A is a liar, B's statement \"A is a liar\" is true, so B is a truth-teller.\n  - If B is a truth-teller, C's statement \"B is a truth-teller\" could be true if C is a truth-teller.\n  - However, if C is a truth-teller, that would make B a liar, which contradicts B being a truth-teller.\n  - Therefore, C must be a liar which makes B's truth-teller status consistent.\n  - With A as a liar, B as a truth-teller, and C as a liar, there is no contradiction.\n\nConclusion:\nA is a liar.\nB is a truth-teller.\nC is a liar.\n\nFinal identities:\n\nA: liar  \nB: truth-teller  \nC: liar"
