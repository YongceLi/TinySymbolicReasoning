  "prompt": "Assume that there exist only two types of people: truth-tellers and liars. Truth-tellers always tell the truth, while liars always lie.\nYou are given the statements from 3 characters. Based on their statements, infer who is a truth-teller and who is a liar.\n\n\nBased on the following statements, infer who is a truth-teller and who is a liar:\nA: C is a liar and B is a liar.\nB: C is a liar and A is a liar.\nC: B is a truth-teller.\n\nLet's think step by step. First, explain your reasoning. End your answer by clearly stating the identity of each character in the following format:\n\nA: truth-teller/liar\nB: truth-teller/liar\nC: truth-teller/liar",
  "response": "To solve this problem, we'll evaluate each character's statements to determine who is a truth-teller and who is a liar.\n\n1. **Analyze A's Statement:**\n   - A: \"C is a liar and B is a liar.\"\n     - If A is a truth-teller, then both B and C must be liars.\n     - If A is a liar, then at least one of B or C must be a truth-teller.\n\n2. **Analyze B's Statement:**\n   - B: \"C is a liar and A is a liar.\"\n     - If B is a truth-teller, then both A and C must be liars.\n     - If B is a liar, then at least one of A or C must be a truth-teller.\n\n3. **Analyze C's Statement:**\n   - C: \"B is a truth-teller.\"\n     - If C is a truth-teller, then B must be a truth-teller.\n     - If C is a liar, then B must be a liar.\n\nNow, let's test various scenarios:\n\n**Scenario 1:** Assume A is a truth-teller.\n   - If A is a truth-teller, both B and C must be liars (according to A's statement).\n   - If B is a liar, then B's statement \"C is a liar and A is a liar\" must be false. This means at least one among C and A is a truth-teller, but we have assumed A is a truth-teller and this is consistent. C can indeed be a liar.\n   - C's statement is \"B is a truth-teller.\" If C is a liar, this is consistent because B, assumed a liar, cannot be a truth-teller.\n\nThis scenario holds together consistently.\n\n**Scenario 2:** Assume B is a truth-teller.\n   - If B is a truth-teller, both A and C must be liars (according to B's statement).\n   - However, C, being a liar, cannot truthfully say \"B is a truth-teller.\" This is a contradiction because if B is a truth-teller, C should also be a liar, creating a paradox with C's statement, which doesn't work.\n\nThis scenario does not hold.\n\n**Scenario 3:** Assume C is a truth-teller.\n   - If C is a truth-teller, B must be a truth-teller (according to C's statement).\n   - But if B is a truth-teller, then both A and C must be liars, which contradicts our assumption that C is a truth-teller.\n\nThis scenario does not hold.\n\nThe only consistent scenario is when A is a truth-teller. Thus, we have:\n\nA: truth-teller\nB: liar\nC: liar"
