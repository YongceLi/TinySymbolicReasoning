  "prompt": "Assume that there exist only two types of people: truth-tellers and liars. Truth-tellers always tell the truth, while liars always lie.\nYou are given the statements from 3 characters. Based on their statements, infer who is a truth-teller and who is a liar.\n\n\nBased on the following statements, infer who is a truth-teller and who is a liar:\nA: If C is a liar, then B is a liar.\nB: If A is a liar, then C is a liar.\nC: B is a liar.\n\nLet's think step by step. First, explain your reasoning. End your answer by clearly stating the identity of each character in the following format:\n\nA: truth-teller/liar\nB: truth-teller/liar\nC: truth-teller/liar",
  "response": "To solve this problem, we will analyze the given statements one by one and determine the identities of A, B, and C.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze A's Statement**  \nA: If C is a liar, then B is a liar.  \nThis is a conditional statement. A truth-teller would make a true conditional statement, and a liar would make a false conditional statement. If A is a truth-teller, then whenever C is a liar, B must also be a liar. Conversely, if A is a liar, there must be a case where C is a liar and B is not.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze B's Statement**  \nB: If A is a liar, then C is a liar.  \nSimilarly, this is a conditional statement. If B is a truth-teller, whenever A is a liar, C must also be a liar. If B is a liar, there must be a scenario where A is a liar and C is not.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze C's Statement**  \nC: B is a liar.  \nIf C is a truth-teller, B must indeed be a liar. If C is a liar, B must be a truth-teller.\n\n**Step 4: Determine the Consistent Scenarios**\n\nLet's consider the possibilities:\n\n1. **Assume A is a truth-teller:**  \n   - C is a liar (from A's statement), so B is also a liar.\n   - If B is a liar, then B's statement \"If A is a liar, then C is a liar\" must be false. It means there exists a case where A is a liar and C is not a liar; but since we assumed A is a truth-teller, this is a contradiction.\n   - Therefore, this assumption leads to a contradiction.\n\n2. **Assume A is a liar:**  \n   - Then, from B's statement: If A is a liar, then C is a liar, B must be true, so C must be a liar to make B's statement true.\n   - If B is a truth-teller, then C's statement \"B is a liar\" must be false.\n   - This is consistent with C being a liar.\n   - Furthermore, A's statement \"If C is a liar, then B is a liar\" is a lie. C is indeed a liar, but B is not a liar; hence, A's lie is consistent.\n\nThus, the consistent scenario is:\n- A is a liar, B is a truth-teller, and C is a liar.\n\nSo the identities are:  \nA: liar  \nB: truth-teller  \nC: liar"
