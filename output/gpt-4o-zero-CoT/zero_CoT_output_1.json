  "prompt": "Assume that there exist only two types of people: truth-tellers and liars. Truth-tellers always tell the truth, while liars always lie.\nYou are given the statements from 3 characters. Based on their statements, infer who is a truth-teller and who is a liar.\n\n\nBased on the following statements, infer who is a truth-teller and who is a liar:\nA: B is a liar.\nB: C is a liar and A is a truth-teller.\nC: I am a truth-teller.\n\nLet's think step by step. First, explain your reasoning. End your answer by clearly stating the identity of each character in the following format:\n\nA: truth-teller/liar\nB: truth-teller/liar\nC: truth-teller/liar",
  "response": "To solve this, we'll evaluate the statements step by step:\n\n1. **Statement Evaluation:**\n   - **A's Statement:** \"B is a liar.\"\n     - If A is a truth-teller, then B must indeed be a liar. \n     - If A is a liar, then B must be a truth-teller.\n   \n   - **B's Statement:** \"C is a liar and A is a truth-teller.\"\n     - This is a compound statement. If B is a truth-teller, then both parts of the statement must be true:\n       - C is a liar.\n       - A is a truth-teller.\n     - If B is a liar, then at least one part of the statement is false.\n\n   - **C's Statement:** \"I am a truth-teller.\"\n     - If C is a truth-teller, then this statement is true.\n     - If C is a liar, then this statement is false.\n\n2. **Determine the Identifications:**\n\n   Let's consider the possibilities:\n\n   **Assume A is a truth-teller:**  \n   - A's statement implies B is a liar.\n   - If B is a liar, then B's statements are false: \n     - Therefore, it is false that \"C is a liar and A is a truth-teller.\" This implies either C is not a liar or A is not a truth-teller or both.\n   - But if A is assumed to be a truth-teller, then only possibility is C is not a liar, meaning C is a truth-teller.\n\n   - This scenario is consistent, as:\n     - A is a truth-teller.\n     - B is a liar.\n     - C is a truth-teller.\n\n   **Assume A is a liar:**\n   - A's statement implies B is a truth-teller.\n   - If B is a truth-teller, then B's statement \"C is a liar and A is a truth-teller\" must be true, which leads to a contradiction since A cannot be both a liar and a truth-teller.\n     - C cannot be both a liar (as per B's truth-telling) and a truth-teller (as per his own statement).\n   - This scenario leads to an inconsistency.\n\nTherefore, the only consistent scenario is:\n\nA: truth-teller  \nB: liar  \nC: truth-teller  "
