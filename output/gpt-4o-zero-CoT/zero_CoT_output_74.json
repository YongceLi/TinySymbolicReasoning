  "prompt": "Assume that there exist only two types of people: truth-tellers and liars. Truth-tellers always tell the truth, while liars always lie.\nYou are given the statements from 3 characters. Based on their statements, infer who is a truth-teller and who is a liar.\n\n\nBased on the following statements, infer who is a truth-teller and who is a liar:\nA: If B is a liar, then C is a liar.\nB: A is a truth-teller.\nC: If A is a liar, then B is a truth-teller.\n\nLet's think step by step. First, explain your reasoning. End your answer by clearly stating the identity of each character in the following format:\n\nA: truth-teller/liar\nB: truth-teller/liar\nC: truth-teller/liar",
  "response": "To solve this problem, let's analyze each character's statement and determine the consistent scenario.\n\n1. **Statement by A**: \"If B is a liar, then C is a liar.\"\n   - If A is a truth-teller, this statement must be true: If B is a liar, then C indeed is a liar.\n   - If A is a liar, this statement must be false: There should be a situation where B is a liar, but C is not.\n\n2. **Statement by B**: \"A is a truth-teller.\"\n   - If B is a truth-teller, then A must indeed be a truth-teller.\n   - If B is a liar, then A is not a truth-teller, meaning A is a liar.\n\n3. **Statement by C**: \"If A is a liar, then B is a truth-teller.\"\n   - If C is a truth-teller, this statement must be true: If A is a liar, then B is a truth-teller.\n   - If C is a liar, then the statement must be false: There should be a scenario where A is a liar, but B is not a truth-teller (meaning B is a liar).\n\nLet's examine possible scenarios:\n\n- Assume A is a truth-teller:\n  - Then B's statement \"A is a truth-teller\" must also be true, so B is a truth-teller.\n  - With A and B both being truth-tellers, C's statement \"If A is a liar, then B is a truth-teller\" can be any falsehood because its premise (A is a liar) is false. This implies C can be a liar.\n  - Check A's statement remains consistent: \"If B is a liar, then C is a liar,\" which is trivially true if B is not a liar, aligning with A being a truth-teller.\n\n- Assume A is a liar:\n  - B's statement \"A is a truth-teller\" becomes false, hence B has to be a liar.\n  - According to C, when A is a liar, B is a truth-teller. However, we found B is a liar, making C's statement false, so C is lying.\n  - No contradictions found here, indicating this scenario works.\n\nNow review the conclusions:\nIf A is a liar, B is a liar, and C is a liar, the scenario holds consistently.\n\nGiven the logical consistency, characters are:\n- A: Liar\n- B: Liar\n- C: Truth-teller"
