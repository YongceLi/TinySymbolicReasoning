  "prompt": "Assume that there exist only two types of people: truth-tellers and liars. Truth-tellers always tell the truth, while liars always lie.\nYou are given the statements from 3 characters. Based on their statements, infer who is a truth-teller and who is a liar.\n\n\nBased on the following statements, infer who is a truth-teller and who is a liar:\nA: C is a liar.\nB: I am a truth-teller.\nC: B is a liar and A is a truth-teller.\n\nLet's think step by step. First, explain your reasoning. End your answer by clearly stating the identity of each character in the following format:\n\nA: truth-teller/liar\nB: truth-teller/liar\nC: truth-teller/liar",
  "response": "To solve this problem, let's analyze the statements one by one.\n\n1. **Assume A is a truth-teller:**\n   - If A is a truth-teller, then A's statement \"C is a liar\" is true. Therefore, C must be a liar.\n   - If C is a liar, then C's statement \"B is a liar and A is a truth-teller\" is false. This means that at least one part of C's statement is false.\n     - Since A is assumed to be a truth-teller, \"A is a truth-teller\" is true, which means the false part must be \"B is a liar.\" Therefore, B must be a truth-teller.\n\n   In this scenario, A is a truth-teller, B is a truth-teller, and C is a liar. This is consistent because the assumptions lead to a coherent truth assignment.\n\n2. **Assume A is a liar:**\n   - If A is a liar, then A's statement \"C is a liar\" is false. Therefore, C must be a truth-teller.\n   - If C is a truth-teller, then C's statement \"B is a liar and A is a truth-teller\" must be true.\n     - Therefore, \"B is a liar\" is true, meaning B is a liar.\n     - \"A is a truth-teller\" must also be true, which contradicts our assumption that A is a liar.\n\n   This scenario leads to a contradiction, so the assumption that A is a liar cannot be correct.\n\nThus, the only consistent scenario is the first one, where A is a truth-teller, B is a truth-teller, and C is a liar.\n\nFinal identities:\nA: truth-teller\nB: truth-teller\nC: liar"
