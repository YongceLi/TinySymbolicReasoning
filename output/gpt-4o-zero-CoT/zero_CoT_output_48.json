  "prompt": "Assume that there exist only two types of people: truth-tellers and liars. Truth-tellers always tell the truth, while liars always lie.\nYou are given the statements from 3 characters. Based on their statements, infer who is a truth-teller and who is a liar.\n\n\nBased on the following statements, infer who is a truth-teller and who is a liar:\nA: C is a liar and B is a truth-teller.\nB: C is a truth-teller.\nC: If B is a truth-teller, then A is a liar.\n\nLet's think step by step. First, explain your reasoning. End your answer by clearly stating the identity of each character in the following format:\n\nA: truth-teller/liar\nB: truth-teller/liar\nC: truth-teller/liar",
  "response": "Let's evaluate the statements one by one and examine the resulting possibilities.\n\nConsider what A says first:\n- A: \"C is a liar and B is a truth-teller.\"\n\nIf A is a truth-teller, then C must indeed be a liar, and B must be a truth-teller.\n\nConsider what B says next:\n- B: \"C is a truth-teller.\"\n\nIf B is a truth-teller, then C is a truth-teller. But this contradicts the situation where A is a truth-teller (because A said C is a liar). Thus, A and B cannot both be truth-tellers.\n\nAssume C is a truth-teller (based on B's statement that C is a truth-teller):\n- If B is a truth-teller, then C should be a truth-teller, which holds true. Thus, under this condition, B is consistent with being a truth-teller if C is a truth-teller. This makes the previous statement about A false as A claimed C is a liar, which is not true. So, if C is a truth-teller, A is a liar.\n\nConsider what C claims:\n- C: \"If B is a truth-teller, then A is a liar.\"\n\nIf C is a truth-teller, then what C says must be true. So, if B is a truth-teller, A must be a liar.\n\nNow let's verify the consistency:\n- If C is a truth-teller, then C's statement holds \u2014 B is a truth-teller implies A is a liar.\n- If B is a truth-teller, then C is a truth-teller (B confirms C is a truth-teller), and A is a liar (from C's statement).\n\nTherefore, the only consistent scenario is:\n- A is a liar.\n- B is a truth-teller.\n- C is a truth-teller.\n\nHere's the final identity evaluation:\n\nA: liar\nB: truth-teller\nC: truth-teller"
