  "prompt": "Assume that there exist only two types of people: truth-tellers and liars. Truth-tellers always tell the truth, while liars always lie.\nYou are given the statements from 3 characters. Based on their statements, infer who is a truth-teller and who is a liar.\n\n\nBased on the following statements, infer who is a truth-teller and who is a liar:\nA: C is a truth-teller and B is a truth-teller.\nB: A is a truth-teller.\nC: A is a liar and B is a truth-teller.\n\nLet's think step by step. First, explain your reasoning. End your answer by clearly stating the identity of each character in the following format:\n\nA: truth-teller/liar\nB: truth-teller/liar\nC: truth-teller/liar",
  "response": "To determine who is a truth-teller and who is a liar, let's analyze each character's statements:\n\n1. **Character A's Statement**: \"C is a truth-teller and B is a truth-teller.\"\n   - If A is telling the truth, then both C and B must be truth-tellers.\n   - However, if C is a truth-teller, his statement (\"A is a liar and B is a truth-teller\") would mean A is lying, which is a contradiction.\n   - Therefore, A cannot be a truth-teller. So, A is a liar.\n\n2. **Character B's Statement**: \"A is a truth-teller.\"\n   - Since we've established that A is a liar, B's statement cannot be true.\n   - Therefore, B is a liar.\n\n3. **Character C's Statement**: \"A is a liar and B is a truth-teller.\"\n   - We know A is a liar, so this part of C's statement is true.\n   - However, C claims B is a truth-teller, which contradicts our conclusion that B is a liar.\n   - Since C's statement contains both a true and a false part, C must be lying about B being a truth-teller.\n   - Therefore, C's overall statement has a falsehood, meaning C is a liar.\n\nSince contradictions arise if either A or B is assumed to tell the truth, and C's false statement aligns with our deduction, all three characters must be liars.\n\nConclusively:\nA: liar\nB: liar\nC: liar"
