  "prompt": "Assume that there exist only two types of people: truth-tellers and liars. Truth-tellers always tell the truth, while liars always lie.\nYou are given the statements from 3 characters. Based on their statements, infer who is a truth-teller and who is a liar.\n\n\nBased on the following statements, infer who is a truth-teller and who is a liar:\nA: If B is a liar, then C is a truth-teller.\nB: C is a liar and A is a truth-teller.\nC: B is a truth-teller.\n\nLet's think step by step. First, explain your reasoning. End your answer by clearly stating the identity of each character in the following format:\n\nA: truth-teller/liar\nB: truth-teller/liar\nC: truth-teller/liar",
  "response": "Let's analyze the statements step by step:\n\n1. **Consider A's statement: \"If B is a liar, then C is a truth-teller.\"**\n\n   - If A is a truth-teller, the statement must be true. Therefore, if B is a liar, C must be a truth-teller.\n   - If A is a liar, the statement is false. This means that even if B is a liar, C is not a truth-teller (i.e., C is a liar).\n\n2. **Consider B's statement: \"C is a liar and A is a truth-teller.\"**\n\n   - If B is a truth-teller, both parts of the statement must be true, meaning C is a liar and A is a truth-teller.\n   - If B is a liar, both parts of the statement are false, meaning C is not a liar (C is a truth-teller) and A is not a truth-teller (A is a liar).\n\n3. **Consider C's statement: \"B is a truth-teller.\"**\n\n   - If C is a truth-teller, B must be a truth-teller.\n   - If C is a liar, B must be a liar.\n\nNow, let's evaluate the possible scenarios:\n\n- **Assume B is a truth-teller:**\n  - According to C's statement, if B is a truth-teller, C is truthful. However, B's statement claims C is a liar, which creates a contradiction. Therefore, this assumption is false.\n\n- **Assume B is a liar:**\n  - According to C's statement, if B is a liar, C is also a liar.\n  - Now consider B's statement: Since B is lying, C is not a liar (C is a truth-teller) and A is not a truth-teller (A is a liar). This is consistent as when B is a liar, according to A's initial statement \"if B is a liar, then C is a truth-teller\" should be false, meaning C is not a truth-teller. \n  - Now B's statement falsity also means A is a liar which is consistent with B being a liar in above inference.\n\nBased on these observations, the only consistent solution is:\n- A is a liar.\n- B is a liar.\n- C is a truth-teller.\n\nIn summary:\n\nA: liar  \nB: liar  \nC: truth-teller  "
