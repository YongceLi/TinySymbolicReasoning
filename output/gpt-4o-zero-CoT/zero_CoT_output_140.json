  "prompt": "Assume that there exist only two types of people: truth-tellers and liars. Truth-tellers always tell the truth, while liars always lie.\nYou are given the statements from 3 characters. Based on their statements, infer who is a truth-teller and who is a liar.\n\n\nBased on the following statements, infer who is a truth-teller and who is a liar:\nA: If C is a liar, then B is a liar.\nB: A is a truth-teller.\nC: If B is a liar, then A is a truth-teller.\n\nLet's think step by step. First, explain your reasoning. End your answer by clearly stating the identity of each character in the following format:\n\nA: truth-teller/liar\nB: truth-teller/liar\nC: truth-teller/liar",
  "response": "To determine who is a truth-teller and who is a liar, let's analyze each statement step by step.\n\n1. **Statement by A:** \"If C is a liar, then B is a liar.\"\n\n   - The conditional statement \"If C is a liar, then B is a liar\" is only false when C is a liar and B is a truth-teller. For A to be telling the truth, the statement must be true or, if A is a liar, the statement must be false.\n\n2. **Statement by B:** \"A is a truth-teller.\"\n\n   - If B is telling the truth, then A must be a truth-teller. If B is lying, then A is a liar.\n\n3. **Statement by C:** \"If B is a liar, then A is a truth-teller.\"\n\n   - The conditional statement \"If B is a liar, then A is a truth-teller\" is only false when B is a liar and A is a liar. For C to be telling the truth, this statement must be true. If C is lying, then B cannot be a liar, and A cannot be a truth-teller simultaneously.\n\nLet's consider the possibilities:\n\n- **Assume A is a truth-teller:**\n  - If A is a truth-teller, their statement must be true. Therefore, if C is a liar, then B must also be a liar.\n  - Next, B claims A is a truth-teller, which is consistent with A being a truth-teller. Therefore, B can be a truth-teller or a liar without contradiction here.\n  - If C is a truth-teller, C's conditional statement \"If B is a liar, then A is a truth-teller\" would mean if B is a liar, A must indeed be a truth-teller. Since A is already assumed to be a truth-teller, this holds.\n  - So, if A is a truth-teller, then B can only be a liar, and C is a truth-teller.\n\n- **Assume A is a liar:**\n  - If A is a liar, then A's statement \"If C is a liar, then B is a liar\" must be false. So it needs C to be a liar, and B to be a truth-teller simultaneously, which is a contradiction since both cannot be liars and truth-tellers under the premise.\n  - This scenario is impossible because it leads to a contradiction.\n\nAfter examining the logical implications, the only consistent assignment is:\n\nA: truth-teller  \nB: liar  \nC: truth-teller  "
