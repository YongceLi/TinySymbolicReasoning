  "prompt": "Assume that there exist only two types of people: truth-tellers and liars. Truth-tellers always tell the truth, while liars always lie.\nYou are given the statements from 3 characters. Based on their statements, infer who is a truth-teller and who is a liar.\n\n\nBased on the following statements, infer who is a truth-teller and who is a liar:\nA: B is a liar and C is a liar.\nB: A is a truth-teller and C is a liar.\nC: I am a truth-teller.\n\nLet's think step by step. First, explain your reasoning. End your answer by clearly stating the identity of each character in the following format:\n\nA: truth-teller/liar\nB: truth-teller/liar\nC: truth-teller/liar",
  "response": "To solve this problem, we'll evaluate the statements by considering the possible identities (truth-teller or liar) of each person. We'll check for consistency under each scenario:\n\n1. **Assume A is a truth-teller**:  \n   - If A is a truth-teller, then A's statement \"B is a liar and C is a liar\" is true. Therefore, both B and C must be liars. \n   - If B is a liar, then B's statement \"A is a truth-teller and C is a liar\" must be false. This means either A is not a truth-teller or C is not a liar. Since A is assumed to be a truth-teller, C cannot be a liar, which contradicts the assumption that C is a liar. Therefore, the assumption that A is a truth-teller leads to a contradiction.\n\n2. **Assume A is a liar**:  \n   - If A is a liar, then A's statement \"B is a liar and C is a liar\" is false. Therefore, at least one of B or C must be a truth-teller.\n   - Let's consider the possibility that B is a truth-teller:\n     - If B is a truth-teller, then B's statement \"A is a truth-teller and C is a liar\" must be true. This creates a contradiction because we assumed A is a liar, which means B cannot be a truth-teller. Thus, B must be a liar.\n   - Since B is a liar, B's statement \"A is a truth-teller and C is a liar\" is false. This means C is not a liar, so C must be a truth-teller.\n   - C's statement \"I am a truth-teller\" would be true if C is a truth-teller, which is consistent with our assumption.\n\nThis scenario does not lead to any contradiction:\n- A is a liar.\n- B is a liar.\n- C is a truth-teller.\n\nThus, the identities of the characters are:\n\nA: liar  \nB: liar  \nC: truth-teller"
