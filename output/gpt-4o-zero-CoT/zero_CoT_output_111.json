  "prompt": "Assume that there exist only two types of people: truth-tellers and liars. Truth-tellers always tell the truth, while liars always lie.\nYou are given the statements from 3 characters. Based on their statements, infer who is a truth-teller and who is a liar.\n\n\nBased on the following statements, infer who is a truth-teller and who is a liar:\nA: C is a truth-teller.\nB: A is a liar and C is a truth-teller.\nC: B is a truth-teller and A is a liar.\n\nLet's think step by step. First, explain your reasoning. End your answer by clearly stating the identity of each character in the following format:\n\nA: truth-teller/liar\nB: truth-teller/liar\nC: truth-teller/liar",
  "response": "To determine who is a truth-teller and who is a liar, let's analyze each character's statements step by step:\n\n1. **Assume A is a truth-teller**:\n   - A says, \"C is a truth-teller.\" If A is telling the truth, C must indeed be a truth-teller.\n   - If C is a truth-teller, C's statement \"B is a truth-teller and A is a liar\" must be true. However, if C claims A is a liar, this contradicts our assumption that A is a truth-teller. Therefore, our assumption that A is a truth-teller leads to a contradiction.\n\n2. **Conclude A is a liar**:\n   - Since A is a liar, A's statement \"C is a truth-teller\" is false. Therefore, C must be a liar.\n\n3. **Determine B's status**:\n   - With A being a liar and C being a liar, let's analyze B's statement: \"A is a liar and C is a truth-teller.\"\n   - We concluded A is a liar, so that part of B's statement is true. However, since C is a liar, the part of B's statement where they claim C is a truth-teller is false.\n   - If B's statement contains a falsehood, B must be a liar.\n\n4. **Verify consistency**:\n   - A is a liar, B is a liar, and C is a liar fits all statements since:\n     - A lying about C indicates C is indeed a liar.\n     - B lying about A and C satisfies our findings that they are both liars.\n     - C lying about B and A also fits since both B and C are liars.\n\nThus, each character consistently lies.\n\nFinal conclusion:\n\nA: liar  \nB: liar  \nC: liar"
