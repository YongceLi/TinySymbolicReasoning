  "prompt": "Assume that there exist only two types of people: truth-tellers and liars. Truth-tellers always tell the truth, while liars always lie.\nYou are given the statements from 3 characters. Based on their statements, infer who is a truth-teller and who is a liar.\n\n\nBased on the following statements, infer who is a truth-teller and who is a liar:\nA: C is a truth-teller and B is a truth-teller.\nB: A is a liar.\nC: A is a truth-teller and B is a liar.\n\nLet's think step by step. First, explain your reasoning. End your answer by clearly stating the identity of each character in the following format:\n\nA: truth-teller/liar\nB: truth-teller/liar\nC: truth-teller/liar",
  "response": "To solve this problem, we need to evaluate the statements made by characters A, B, and C, given that each character is either a truth-teller or a liar.\n\nFirst, let's analyze each statement:\n\n1. **A's Statement**: A claims \"C is a truth-teller and B is a truth-teller.\"\n   - If A is a truth-teller, then both C and B must be truth-tellers.\n   - If A is a liar, then at least one of C or B must be a liar.\n\n2. **B's Statement**: B claims \"A is a liar.\"\n   - If B is a truth-teller, then A must be a liar.\n   - If B is a liar, then A must be a truth-teller.\n\n3. **C's Statement**: C claims \"A is a truth-teller and B is a liar.\"\n   - If C is a truth-teller, then A is a truth-teller and B is a liar.\n   - If C is a liar, either A is a liar or B is a truth-teller.\n\nWe will consider different scenarios based on these statements:\n\n**Scenario 1**: Assume A is a truth-teller.\n- If A is a truth-teller, according to A's statement, both B and C must be truth-tellers.\n- But C claimed \"A is a truth-teller and B is a liar,\" which contradicts B being a truth-teller.\n- So A cannot be a truth-teller.\n\n**Scenario 2**: Assume A is a liar.\n- If A is a liar, then not both C and B are truth-tellers. Therefore, at least one of C or B is a liar.\n\nNow let's analyze the implications if A is a liar:\n\n- **Consider B as a truth-teller**:\n  - If B is a truth-teller, then according to B, A is a liar, which is consistent. But what's critical is to check C here:\n  - If B is a truth-teller, C must be a liar; because if C were truth-teller, this would contradict B's truth (as C says B is a liar).\n  \n- **Check B's possible scenario**: If B is a liar, it implies A is a truth-teller (as B's statement \"A is a liar\" would be false), which contradicts our assumption that A is a liar.\n\nHence, B must be a truth-teller, which makes A a liar, and accordingly, C must be a liar too, because a truth-telling B would be contradicted by truth-telling C's statement.\n\nThus, the identities are:\n- A must be a liar.\n- B must be a truth-teller.\n- C must be a liar.\n\nTherefore:\n\nA: liar  \nB: truth-teller  \nC: liar"
