  "prompt": "Assume that there exist only two types of people: truth-tellers and liars. Truth-tellers always tell the truth, while liars always lie.\nYou are given the statements from 3 characters. Based on their statements, infer who is a truth-teller and who is a liar.\n\n\nBased on the following statements, infer who is a truth-teller and who is a liar:\nA: C is a truth-teller and B is a liar.\nB: C is a truth-teller if and only if A is a truth-teller.\nC: B is a liar.\n\nLet's think step by step. First, explain your reasoning. End your answer by clearly stating the identity of each character in the following format:\n\nA: truth-teller/liar\nB: truth-teller/liar\nC: truth-teller/liar",
  "response": "To solve this problem, we need to evaluate the consistency of each person's statements, identifying whether they adhere to the characteristics of a truth-teller or a liar.\n\n### Evaluation:\n\n1. **Statement by A**: \"C is a truth-teller and B is a liar.\"\n\n   - If A is a truth-teller, then their statement must be true. This would mean C is a truth-teller and B is a liar.\n   - If A is a liar, then their statement must be false. This would mean that either C is not a truth-teller, B is not a liar, or both.\n\n2. **Statement by B**: \"C is a truth-teller if and only if A is a truth-teller.\"\n\n   - Consider the two possibilities:\n     - If B is a truth-teller, then their whole statement must be true. Therefore, C being a truth-teller would mean A is a truth-teller (and vice versa).\n     - If B is a liar, the statement is false. This means that either C being a truth-teller does not imply A is a truth-teller, or vice versa.\n\n3. **Statement by C**: \"B is a liar.\"\n\n   - If C is a truth-teller, then B must be a liar.\n   - If C is a liar, then B must be a truth-teller.\n\n### Logical Deduction:\n\n- Assume A is a truth-teller:\n  - A's statement \"C is a truth-teller and B is a liar\" must be true. So, C is a truth-teller and B is a liar.\n  - This assumption is self-consistent. If C is a truth-teller, C's statement \"B is a liar\" holds true.\n  - B's statement \"C is a truth-teller if and only if A is a truth-teller\" becomes true because both C and A are truth-tellers, so this is consistent.\n\n- Assume A is a liar:\n  - A's statement \"C is a truth-teller and B is a liar\" must be false, so either C is not a truth-teller, B is not a liar, or both.\n  - If C is not a truth-teller, then C is a liar and C's statement \"B is a liar\" is false, meaning B is a truth-teller.\n  - B's statement \"C is a truth-teller if and only if A is a truth-teller\" being false also indicates A is not a truth-teller which is consistent with initial assumption here.\n\n  This results in a contradiction arising because both assumptions have statements that align internally: but the solution must find a consistent set among all assumptions.\n\nThus, the only consistent configuration is:\n\n- **A is a truth-teller**.\n- **B is a liar**.\n- **C is a truth-teller**.\n\nThese identities ensure the statements are consistent when checked thoroughly.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nA: truth-teller  \nB: liar  \nC: truth-teller  "
