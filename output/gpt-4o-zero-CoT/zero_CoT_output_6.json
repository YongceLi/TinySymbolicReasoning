  "prompt": "Assume that there exist only two types of people: truth-tellers and liars. Truth-tellers always tell the truth, while liars always lie.\nYou are given the statements from 3 characters. Based on their statements, infer who is a truth-teller and who is a liar.\n\n\nBased on the following statements, infer who is a truth-teller and who is a liar:\nA: B is a liar and C is a truth-teller.\nB: C is a truth-teller and A is a liar.\nC: B is a liar.\n\nLet's think step by step. First, explain your reasoning. End your answer by clearly stating the identity of each character in the following format:\n\nA: truth-teller/liar\nB: truth-teller/liar\nC: truth-teller/liar",
  "response": "To solve this problem, let's examine the statements made by each character.\n\n1. **Statement by A**: \"B is a liar and C is a truth-teller.\"\n   - If A is a truth-teller, then B must be a liar and C must be a truth-teller.\n   - If A is a liar, then at least one part of A's statement is false.\n\n2. **Statement by B**: \"C is a truth-teller and A is a liar.\"\n   - If B is a truth-teller, then C must be a truth-teller, and A must be a liar.\n   - If B is a liar, then at least one part of B's statement is false.\n\n3. **Statement by C**: \"B is a liar.\"\n   - If C is a truth-teller, then B is indeed a liar.\n   - If C is a liar, then B is not a liar (meaning B is a truth-teller).\n\nNow, let's analyze these possibilities:\n\n- **Assume A is a truth-teller**:\n  - Then, B is a liar and C is a truth-teller (from A's statement).\n  - This is consistent with C's statement that \"B is a liar.\"\n  - However, if B is a liar, B's statement \"C is a truth-teller\" and \"A is a liar\" cannot be fully true. But, if B is lying, then C is indeed a truth-teller, which matches the assumption but contradicts B saying \"A is a liar\".\n\n- **Assume A is a liar**:\n  - Then, at least one part of \"B is a liar and C is a truth-teller\" is false.\n  - If we assume B is a truth-teller (because A is lying about B being a liar), then B's statement \"C is a truth-teller and A is a liar\" must be true.\n  - This leads to C being a truth-teller as stated by both B and A (who lied about B).\n  - So, consistent with this assumption, B is a truth-teller, C is a truth-teller, and A is lying.\n\nBased on this analysis, the only consistent scenario is:\n- A is a liar\n- B is a truth-teller\n- C is a truth-teller\n\nTherefore, the final identities are:\n\nA: liar  \nB: truth-teller  \nC: truth-teller"
