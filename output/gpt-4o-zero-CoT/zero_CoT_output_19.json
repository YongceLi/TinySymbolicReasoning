  "prompt": "Assume that there exist only two types of people: truth-tellers and liars. Truth-tellers always tell the truth, while liars always lie.\nYou are given the statements from 3 characters. Based on their statements, infer who is a truth-teller and who is a liar.\n\n\nBased on the following statements, infer who is a truth-teller and who is a liar:\nA: C is a truth-teller and B is a truth-teller.\nB: C is a liar and A is a truth-teller.\nC: B is a liar and A is a truth-teller.\n\nLet's think step by step. First, explain your reasoning. End your answer by clearly stating the identity of each character in the following format:\n\nA: truth-teller/liar\nB: truth-teller/liar\nC: truth-teller/liar",
  "response": "To determine who are the truth-tellers and who are the liars among A, B, and C, we must analyze their statements and the implications of them being either truth-tellers or liars. Here\u2019s a step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. **Analyze A's statement**: A says \"C is a truth-teller and B is a truth-teller.\"\n   - If A is a truth-teller, then both C and B must be truth-tellers. However, this situation cannot occur because if B is a truth-teller, B's statement (\"C is a liar\") contradicts A's statement that C is a truth-teller.\n\n2. Since A cannot be a truth-teller (as it leads to a contradiction), A must be a liar. This means A's statement is false. Therefore, at least one of C or B must be a liar.\n\n3. **Analyze B's statement**: B says \"C is a liar and A is a truth-teller.\"\n   - Since we've established that A is a liar, B's statement that \"A is a truth-teller\" must be false. Hence, B is also a liar.\n\n4. **Analyze C's statement**: C says \"B is a liar and A is a truth-teller.\"\n   - Since B is indeed a liar and A is a liar (as we have already concluded), C's statement is partially true (since B is a liar), fulfilling the requirements for C\u2019s statement being considered as truthful given two contradicting statements (B and A\u2019s true or false nature). Therefore, C must be a truth-teller.\n\nUsing these deductions, the identities of each character are:\n- A: liar\n- B: liar\n- C: truth-teller"
