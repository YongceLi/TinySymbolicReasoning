  "prompt": "Assume that there exist only two types of people: truth-tellers and liars. Truth-tellers always tell the truth, while liars always lie.\nYou are given the statements from 3 characters. Based on their statements, infer who is a truth-teller and who is a liar.\n\n\nBased on the following statements, infer who is a truth-teller and who is a liar:\nA: If C is a liar, then B is a liar.\nB: If C is a truth-teller, then A is a liar.\nC: A is a liar if and only if B is a liar.\n\nLet's think step by step. First, explain your reasoning. End your answer by clearly stating the identity of each character in the following format:\n\nA: truth-teller/liar\nB: truth-teller/liar\nC: truth-teller/liar",
  "response": "To determine who is a truth-teller and who is a liar, let's analyze each statement:\n\n1. **Statement A:** \"If C is a liar, then B is a liar.\"\n2. **Statement B:** \"If C is a truth-teller, then A is a liar.\"\n3. **Statement C:** \"A is a liar if and only if B is a liar.\"\n\nLet\u2019s evaluate possible scenarios:\n\n### Scenario 1: Assume C is a truth-teller.\n- If C is a truth-teller, then C's statement must be true:\n  - \"A is a liar if and only if B is a liar\" means A and B must have the same truth value (both lie or both tell the truth).\n\n- According to B\u2019s statement, since C is a truth-teller, A is a liar must be true:\n  - This means A is a liar.\n\n- But if A is a liar, according to C's truth (A and B have the same truth value), B should also be a liar.\n- Therefore, both A and B must be liars:\n  - A: Liar\n  - B: Liar\n  - C: Truth-teller\n\nCheck the consistency with A\u2019s statement:\n- A's statement \"If C is a liar, then B is a liar\" doesn't imply anything if C is a truth-teller, so there\u2019s no contradiction.\n\n### Scenario 2: Assume C is a liar.\n- If C is a liar, then C's statement \"A is a liar if and only if B is a liar\" is false:\n  - This means A and B don\u2019t have the same truth value (one lies and one tells the truth).\n\n- According to A\u2019s statement in this case, \"If C is a liar, then B is a liar\" must be true (since A's statement is a logical equivalent, A must be a truth-teller if this is correct).\n- Therefore, B must be a liar.\n\n- So, C is a liar, B is a liar, and A is a truth-teller:\n  - A: Truth-teller\n  - B: Liar\n  - C: Liar\n\nVerify consistency with B's statement:\n- B's statement \"If C is a truth-teller, then A is a liar\" is irrelevant here since C is a liar.\n\nFrom the two scenarios, the valid consistent scenario is:\n\n**A: Truth-teller  \nB: Liar  \nC: Liar**"
