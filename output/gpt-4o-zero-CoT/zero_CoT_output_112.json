  "prompt": "Assume that there exist only two types of people: truth-tellers and liars. Truth-tellers always tell the truth, while liars always lie.\nYou are given the statements from 3 characters. Based on their statements, infer who is a truth-teller and who is a liar.\n\n\nBased on the following statements, infer who is a truth-teller and who is a liar:\nA: B is a truth-teller.\nB: C is a liar and A is a liar.\nC: I am a truth-teller.\n\nLet's think step by step. First, explain your reasoning. End your answer by clearly stating the identity of each character in the following format:\n\nA: truth-teller/liar\nB: truth-teller/liar\nC: truth-teller/liar",
  "response": "To determine who are the truth-tellers and who are the liars, we'll analyze each person's statement:\n\n1. **Statement A:** \"B is a truth-teller.\"\n   - If A is a truth-teller, then B must also be a truth-teller.\n   - If A is a liar, then B must be a liar.\n\n2. **Statement B:** \"C is a liar and A is a liar.\"\n   - If B is a truth-teller, then both C and A must be liars.\n   - If B is a liar, then at least one of these parts must be false, which implies either C is a truth-teller or A is a truth-teller (or both).\n\n3. **Statement C:** \"I am a truth-teller.\"\n   - If C is a truth-teller, then C is telling the truth.\n   - If C is a liar, then C is lying about being a truth-teller.\n\nLet's consider the possibilities step-by-step:\n\n- Assume A is a truth-teller:\n  - From A's statement, B must be a truth-teller.\n  - If B is a truth-teller, then according to B's statement, both C and A must be liars, which contradicts our assumption that A is a truth-teller.\n  - Therefore, A cannot be a truth-teller.\n\n- Assume A is a liar:\n  - From A's statement, B must be a liar.\n  - If B is a liar, then at least one part of B's statement is false, meaning either A or C must be a truth-teller.\n  - Since A is assumed to be a liar, C must be a truth-teller.\n\nChecking the consistency:\n- If C is a truth-teller, then C's statement \"I am a truth-teller\" is true, so C is indeed a truth-teller, which is consistent with our assumption.\n- Since B stated that C is a liar and A is a liar, and since C is actually a truth-teller, this is consistent with B being a liar.\n- Since B is a liar, A must be a liar as well according to A's statement.\n\nTherefore, the identities are:\nA: liar\nB: liar\nC: truth-teller"
