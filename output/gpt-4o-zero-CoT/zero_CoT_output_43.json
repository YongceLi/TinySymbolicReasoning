  "prompt": "Assume that there exist only two types of people: truth-tellers and liars. Truth-tellers always tell the truth, while liars always lie.\nYou are given the statements from 3 characters. Based on their statements, infer who is a truth-teller and who is a liar.\n\n\nBased on the following statements, infer who is a truth-teller and who is a liar:\nA: B is a liar.\nB: C is a truth-teller if and only if A is a truth-teller.\nC: A is a truth-teller and B is a liar.\n\nLet's think step by step. First, explain your reasoning. End your answer by clearly stating the identity of each character in the following format:\n\nA: truth-teller/liar\nB: truth-teller/liar\nC: truth-teller/liar",
  "response": "Let's analyze the statements step by step:\n\n1. **Statement by A: \"B is a liar.\"**  \n   - If A is a truth-teller, then B must be a liar.\n   - If A is a liar, then B must be a truth-teller.\n\n2. **Statement by B: \"C is a truth-teller if and only if A is a truth-teller.\"**  \n   - This is a biconditional statement.\n   - If B is a truth-teller, then this statement must be true, implying C is a truth-teller if and only if A is a truth-teller.\n   - If B is a liar, then this statement must be false, implying C is a truth-teller if and only if A is a liar.\n\n3. **Statement by C: \"A is a truth-teller and B is a liar.\"**  \n   - If C is a truth-teller, then both conditions must be true: A is a truth-teller and B is a liar.\n   - If C is a liar, then at least one of these conditions is false: A is not a truth-teller or B is not a liar (or both).\n\nLet's now test possible scenarios:\n\n- **Assume A is a truth-teller:**\n  - From A's statement, B is a liar.\n  - From B's statement, C would not be a truth-teller (since B's statement has to be a lie).\n  - But if C is not a truth-teller, then C's statement \u201cA is a truth-teller and B is a liar\u201d would be false, causing a contradiction since we assumed A is a truth-teller.\n\n- **Assume A is a liar:**\n  - From A's statement, B is a truth-teller.\n  - From B's truthful statement, the biconditional relation tells us that: C is a truth-teller if and only if A is a truth-teller. Since A is not a truth-teller, C must not be a truth-teller either (meaning C is a liar).\n  - Since C is a liar, their statement \u201cA is a truth-teller and B is a liar\u201d is false, aligning with B being a truth-teller and A being a liar.\n\nTherefore, the only consistent scenario is:\n\nA: liar  \nB: truth-teller  \nC: liar  "
