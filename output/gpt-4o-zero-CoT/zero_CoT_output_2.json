  "prompt": "Assume that there exist only two types of people: truth-tellers and liars. Truth-tellers always tell the truth, while liars always lie.\nYou are given the statements from 3 characters. Based on their statements, infer who is a truth-teller and who is a liar.\n\n\nBased on the following statements, infer who is a truth-teller and who is a liar:\nA: If C is a liar, then B is a truth-teller.\nB: If A is a truth-teller, then C is a truth-teller.\nC: If A is a liar, then B is a truth-teller.\n\nLet's think step by step. First, explain your reasoning. End your answer by clearly stating the identity of each character in the following format:\n\nA: truth-teller/liar\nB: truth-teller/liar\nC: truth-teller/liar",
  "response": "To solve the problem, let\u2019s analyze the statements provided by A, B, and C:\n\n1. **A's statement**: \"If C is a liar, then B is a truth-teller.\" \n   - This is a conditional statement. For A's statement to be true:\n     - If C is a liar (C = L), then B must be a truth-teller (B = T).\n\n2. **B's statement**: \"If A is a truth-teller, then C is a truth-teller.\" \n   - Another conditional statement. For B\u2019s statement to be true:\n     - If A is a truth-teller (A = T), then C must be a truth-teller (C = T).\n\n3. **C's statement**: \"If A is a liar, then B is a truth-teller.\"\n   - Again, a conditional statement. For C\u2019s statement to be true:\n     - If A is a liar (A = L), then B must be a truth-teller (B = T).\n\nNow, let's explore the possibilities:\n\n### Assume A is a truth-teller (A = T):\n- **From A's statement**: \n  - If C is a liar, then B is a truth-teller.\n- **From B's statement**: \n  - If A is a truth-teller, C is also a truth-teller (C = T).\n  \n  This leads to a consistent scenario when A is a truth-teller:\n  - **B's statement is true** because if A is T, we have C = T.\n  - **C\u2019s statement doesn't apply since A is not a liar.**\n  \n  Hence, if A = T, then B = L (as C is truthful and did not say B must be truthful too) and C = T.\n\n### Let's test this assumption:\n- A = T: \n  - C = T (by B's conditional statement).\n  - Thus, B must be L as when A assumed C was a liar, the alternative must hold.\n\nThus, the assumption A = T leads us to:\n- A = T\n- B = L\n- C = T\n\nLet's verify:\n\n1. **A's statement**: \"If C is a liar, then B is a truth-teller.\" \n   - C is a truth-teller, so the if-part is not satisfied which trivially makes A's statement true.\n\n2. **B's statement**: \"If A is a truth-teller, then C is a truth-teller.\" \n   - A is indeed truthful, making B\u2019s statement also a lie as it contradicts the assumption itself.\n\n3. **C's statement**: \"If A is a liar, then B is a truth-teller.\"\n   - Again, it only holds when A is not lying but as B is a liar, C's statement is correctly false.\n\nTherefore, the identities are:\n- A: Truth-teller\n- B: Liar\n- C: Truth-teller"
