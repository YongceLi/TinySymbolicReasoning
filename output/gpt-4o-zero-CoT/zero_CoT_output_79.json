  "prompt": "Assume that there exist only two types of people: truth-tellers and liars. Truth-tellers always tell the truth, while liars always lie.\nYou are given the statements from 3 characters. Based on their statements, infer who is a truth-teller and who is a liar.\n\n\nBased on the following statements, infer who is a truth-teller and who is a liar:\nA: C is a liar.\nB: If C is a truth-teller, then A is a liar.\nC: B is a truth-teller.\n\nLet's think step by step. First, explain your reasoning. End your answer by clearly stating the identity of each character in the following format:\n\nA: truth-teller/liar\nB: truth-teller/liar\nC: truth-teller/liar",
  "response": "To solve this problem, let's break down the statements and analyze them step by step:\n\n1. **Statement by A**: \"C is a liar.\"\n   - If A is a truth-teller, then C is indeed a liar.\n   - If A is a liar, then C is a truth-teller.\n\n2. **Statement by B**: \"If C is a truth-teller, then A is a liar.\"\n   - If B is a truth-teller, then this statement must hold true: if C is a truth-teller, then A must indeed be a liar.\n   - If B is a liar, then the opposite of the statement must be true: if C is a truth-teller, then A is not a liar (meaning A is a truth-teller), or if C is a liar, A is a liar.\n\n3. **Statement by C**: \"B is a truth-teller.\"\n   - If C is a truth-teller, then B is indeed a truth-teller.\n   - If C is a liar, then B is a liar.\n\nNow, let's consider the possibilities:\n\n- Assume **C is a truth-teller**:\n  - By C's statement, B is a truth-teller.\n  - If B is a truth-teller and given his statement, if C (who we assumed is a truth-teller) is a truth-teller, then A must be a liar.\n  - Therefore, if C is a truth-teller, B is a truth-teller and A is a liar.\n\n- Assume **C is a liar**:\n  - By C's statement, since C is lying, B must be a liar.\n  - If B is a liar, then his statement is false. So, if C is a truth-teller, A is not a liar, implying A is a truth-teller.\n  - Since we assumed C is a liar, we need this assumption to lead to contradictions only resolvable by A being consistent as a truth-teller, which it doesn't originally provide unrefutable output.\n\nComparing these consistent outcomes with assumed truthfulness of C:\n1. If C is a truth-teller, A is a liar, B is a truth-teller.\n2. If C is a liar, A is a truth-teller, B is a liar.\n\nSince both interpretations initially won\u2019t provide consistent unrefutable results with the assumptions, only when transitioning future elaborated possibilities of A\u2019s statement offsetting C\u2019s statement tells that B and C could only likely share a mixed validity requiring A\u2019s statement force C\u2019s falseness avoiding standalone truthfulness.\nHence:\n\nA: liar  \nB: truth-teller  \nC: truth-teller  "
