  "prompt": "Assume that there exist only two types of people: truth-tellers and liars. Truth-tellers always tell the truth, while liars always lie.\nYou are given the statements from 3 characters. Based on their statements, infer who is a truth-teller and who is a liar.\n\n\nBased on the following statements, infer who is a truth-teller and who is a liar:\nA: If C is a truth-teller, then B is a liar.\nB: C is a truth-teller.\nC: If B is a truth-teller, then A is a liar.\n\nLet's think step by step. First, explain your reasoning. End your answer by clearly stating the identity of each character in the following format:\n\nA: truth-teller/liar\nB: truth-teller/liar\nC: truth-teller/liar",
  "response": "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the logical consistency of the statements made by A, B, and C.\n\n1. **Analyzing A's statement:**   \n   A says, \"If C is a truth-teller, then B is a liar.\"   \n   This is a conditional statement. For it to be true, if C is indeed a truth-teller, then B must be a liar. If C is a liar, the statement can be either true or false (since a false antecedent can lead to a true or false conclusion).\n\n2. **Analyzing B's statement:**   \n   B says, \"C is a truth-teller.\"   \n   If B is a truth-teller, then C must indeed be a truth-teller. If B is a liar, then C is a liar.\n\n3. **Analyzing C's statement:**   \n   C says, \"If B is a truth-teller, then A is a liar.\"   \n   This is another conditional statement. For this to be true, if B is a truth-teller, then A must be a liar. If B is a liar, the statement can be either true or false.\n\nLet's consider possible scenarios:\n\n- **Assume initially that C is a truth-teller:**  \n  If C is a truth-teller, then the statement by C (\"If B is a truth-teller, then A is a liar\") holds. Thus, if B is a truth-teller, then A must be a liar.  \n  According to B's statement, B claims that C is a truth-teller. If B is also a truth-teller, this creates a contradiction because A cannot be both a truth-teller and a liar.  \n  So, B must be lying (meaning B is a liar), making A consistent with C's statement as a truth-teller.\n\n- **Verification of A's initial assumption:**  \n  Since C is a truth-teller, according to A's statement (\"If C is a truth-teller, then B is a liar\"), B must be a liar, which aligns with our previous deduction.\n\nTherefore, the configuration that satisfies all statements without contradiction is:\n\nA: truth-teller  \nB: liar  \nC: truth-teller"
