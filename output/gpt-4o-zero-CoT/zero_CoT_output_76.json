  "prompt": "Assume that there exist only two types of people: truth-tellers and liars. Truth-tellers always tell the truth, while liars always lie.\nYou are given the statements from 3 characters. Based on their statements, infer who is a truth-teller and who is a liar.\n\n\nBased on the following statements, infer who is a truth-teller and who is a liar:\nA: B is a truth-teller if and only if C is a truth-teller.\nB: C is a truth-teller and A is a truth-teller.\nC: If B is a truth-teller, then A is a liar.\n\nLet's think step by step. First, explain your reasoning. End your answer by clearly stating the identity of each character in the following format:\n\nA: truth-teller/liar\nB: truth-teller/liar\nC: truth-teller/liar",
  "response": "To determine who is a truth-teller and who is a liar, we'll analyze each statement with the understanding that truth-tellers always tell the truth and liars always lie.\n\n1. **Statement A:** \"B is a truth-teller if and only if C is a truth-teller.\"\n   - This means both B and C must have the same identity: either both are truth-tellers or both are liars.\n\n2. **Statement B:** \"C is a truth-teller and A is a truth-teller.\"\n   - B claims both C and A are truth-tellers.\n\n3. **Statement C:** \"If B is a truth-teller, then A is a liar.\"\n   - Here, if B is a truth-teller, then A must be a liar.\n\nNow, let's evaluate possible scenarios:\n\n- **Assume A is a truth-teller:**\n  - From A's statement, B and C must have the same identity.\n  \n  - If A is a truth-teller, B's statement that both A and C are truth-tellers must be true. Therefore, B would be a truth-teller, and so would C.\n  - But if B is a truth-teller, C's statement implies A is a liar, which contradicts our assumption that A is a truth-teller. Therefore, this scenario is impossible.\n\n- **Assume A is a liar:**\n  - Therefore, A's statement is false. It cannot be true that B and C are both truth-tellers or both liars.\n\n  - C's statement \"If B is a truth-teller, then A is a liar\" must be true (since C must lie if they are a liar when we test this scenario).\n  - If C is a liar, C's statement becomes vacuously true (since it argues a condition that can't be fulfilled: a truth-telling B implies a lie from A, which we already assume to be false, consistent with A being a liar).\n\nGiven that A is already assumed a liar, B and C can't both be truth-tellers:\n  - If B is a truth-teller (implying C's statement is true), then A being a liar remains consistent with B's truth-telling saying C is a truth-teller, but C, if a truth-teller, would contradict A and aligns with B being a truth-teller condition where C implies B needs to make a conditional false; thus B can also only be a liar scenario.\n\nWith B as a liar, C must be a truth-teller to satisfy A lying and B's false conjunction:\n  - Therefore, if A is a liar, then C is a truth-teller whose truth is satisfied by B needing only one falsehood (A can't be a truth-teller). \n  - C being true, makes B a liar as its assertion C and A are lies.\n  \nThis satisfies the conditions: A's original statement as false, B cannot be a truth-teller under consistent conditions, and C, the only remaining, takes truth.\n\nTherefore, the identity of each character is:\n\nA: liar  \nB: liar  \nC: truth-teller  "
